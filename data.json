To achieve this, a lot of efforts/initiatives are\ntaken by the Institute as listed below:\nThe curriculum formulated in our institute is well structured,\nenables CBCS implementation, provides Multiple Entry Multiple\nExit(MEME) options and incorporates Outcome Based Education(OBE)\nframework.\nb) As engineering programs have STEM intensive courses, the\nInstitute has taken efforts towards the integration of humanities\nand science with STEM by the introduction of following courses in\nthe curriculum.\nPage 6/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n1.\nUniversal Human Values- Implications of the Holistic\nUnderstanding of Harmony on Professional Ethics\n2.\nConstitution of India, Professional Ethics and Cyber Law \u2013To\nUnderstand engineering ethics and their responsibilities,\nidentify their individual roles and ethical responsibilities\ntowards society.\n3.\nBiology for Engineers -To motivate the students & develop the\ninterdisciplinary vision of biological engineering. The course\nis expected to encourage engineering students to think about\nsolving biological problems with engineering tools.\n4.\nNSS/Physical Education/Yoga\u2013Introduction of yoga/physical\neducation/NSS in the curriculum have a multitude of benefits\nfor students, as it will have a positive impact on academic\nperformance.\n5.\nSocial Innovation-Social Innovation course designed in the\nfirst year of study, where the students identify the existing\nlocal social problems and propose a solution for it.\nc) & d) Multiple Entry and Multiple Exit (MEME):The multiple entry\nand exit points in the academic programmes would remove rigid\nboundaries and create new possibilities for students. To facilitate\nflexible learning within the stipulated period (eight years for\nregular students and 06 years for lateral entry students), multiple-\nentry and multiple-exit options are offered to needy students. While\nearning credits towards their B.E. degree, the students may\njudiciously use the options provided to them through CBCS and MEME\nclauses in the Regulations, to obtain additional certificates after\ntwo years and a B.Sc. degree in engineering after three years.\nHowever, they shall earn the required credits for the award of the\ndegree within the maximum specified duration.\ne) & f) One of the good practices of our Institute is the\nimplementation of a flexible and customizable curriculum by offering\nelectives in all the years of study that allows students to take\ncourses from different disciplines, thereby promoting a\nmultidisciplinary approach. This also allows students to choose\ncourses that are aligned with their interests and career\naspirations. The institution also encourages project/problem-based\nlearning, which involves students working on real-world problems\nthat require input from multiple disciplines. This approach promotes\ncollaboration and interdisciplinary learning, as students work\ntogether to find solutions to complex problems.\nInternships are offered in the first and second year itself to\nprovide an opportunity for students to gain practical, hands-on\nexperience in their chosen field and build their resumes.\nPage 7/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nIndustry relevant electives are offered that help students gain\npractical knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to their\nchosen careers. Also, adjunct faculty from industries are appointed\nto teach these courses so that students can gain insights into\ncurrent trends, challenges, and opportunities.\n16.Academic bank of credits (ABC):\na) & b) The UGC has been working to promote the adoption of the ABC\nsystem by institutions across India and has developed guidelines and\nframeworks to support its implementation. The Institute has already\nregistered with National Academic Depositary (NAD) and is in the\nprocess of registering with Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) as and\nwhen the facility is offered by the Ministry of Education,\nGovernment of India. However, our institute has already started\noffering credit-based courses.\n1.\nOffering Credit-Based Courses: The institution offers credit-\nbased courses that allow students to earn credits for\ncompleting assignments, projects, and exams. This approach\nprovides students with more flexibility and control for\ntransfer of credits from one institution to another\ninstitution using ABC.\n \nc) The institution is making efforts to collaborate with several\nreputed foreign universities and institutions to offer joint\nprograms and research opportunities to facilitate the exchange of\nknowledge, expertise, and resources, and promote\ninternationalization of education.\n \nd) The institution encourages its faculty members to design their\nown curricular and pedagogical approaches within the approved\nTeaching-Learning framework as follows:\n1.\nAutonomy: The institution provides academic autonomy to its\nfaculty members to design their own courses, select textbooks,\nreading materials, assignments, and assessments which has\nenabled our faculty members to innovate and experiment with\nnew pedagogical approaches.\n2.\nFaculty Development Programs (FDP): The institution conducts\nregular FDPs to provide faculty members with training and\nsupport in designing and implementing new pedagogical\nPage 8/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\napproaches. These programs help faculty members to upgrade\ntheir skills, enhance their knowledge, and adopt best\npractices in teaching and learning.\n3.\nThe institution has College Academic Affairs Committee (CAAC)\nthat reviews and approves course proposals submitted by\nfaculty members. This committee provides feedback and\nsuggestions to faculty members on how to improve their courses\nand align them with the institution's overall academic goals\nand objectives.\n4.\nThe institution has assessment policies given by College\nAccreditation Committee (CAC) that provides guidelines and\nstandards for evaluating student learning outcomes.\n5.\nFeedback Mechanisms: The institution has feedback mechanisms\nthat enable students to provide feedback on the curriculum &\nquality of teaching and learning in their courses. Faculty\nmembers use this feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir pedagogical approaches and make necessary adjustments to\nimprove student learning outcomes.\nCentre for Creative Teaching & Learning (CCTL): Our institute has an\nactive Centre for Creative Teaching & Learning with an objective to\nexplore innovative teaching-learning techniques, practice them and\nshare their merits and applicability among faculty members.\nProvision is also made on the Institute website about various\nmethods/innovations of teaching-learning, and to give\nfeedback/suggestions/critique. This committee meets regularly &\ndiscusses various methods and their effectiveness and shares with\nother faculty members during monthly faculty interaction meetings.\nThe feedback on teaching-learning has significantly increased in the\nlast couple of years due to successful implementation of T-L\ntechniques which are suggested by CCTL.\n17.Skill development:\na) & b) The institute has taken several efforts to strengthen the\nvocational education and soft skills of students in alignment with\nthe National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF).Some of the key\ninitiatives are:\n1.\nInstitute has set up an Indian Society for Heating,\nRefrigerating, and Airconditioning  Engineers(ISHRAE) showcase\nin association with industries, which is first of its kind in\nsouth India to provide vocational training in refrigeration &\nair conditioning  to the candidates of Mysuru region. In\naddition, it conducts seminars/talks/workshops for skill\ndevelopment of our students.\nPage 9/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n2.\nCurriculum Alignment:\n1.\nSkill development courses are integral part of our\nInstitute\u2019s curriculum to nurture student proficiency\nskills.\n2.\nAbility Enhancement Courses(AE) are the generic skill\ncourses which are basic and needed to all to ensure\nprogression across all careers.\n3.\nThe institute has established strong industry collaborations\nto provide students with hands-on training and work\nexperience. The Institute has MOUs with Holosuit,Harappa\neducation, LTTS,Vivarthan,Dassault and many more.\n4.\nThe institute encourage students to take up,\n  (i) an interdisciplinary Research Internship or Industry\ninternship and\n  (ii) a rural internship,a work-based activity carried out to learn\npractical experiences in rural areas,for the upliftment of living\nstandards.\n5. The institute offers soft skills training programs to develop\nstudents' interpersonal skills,communication skills,and leadership\nskills right from first semester.\n6. Institute has more than 40 Student clubs for overall development\nof student community.To foster entrepreneurial, leadership,\ncommunication & technical skills we have E-Cell,toast\nmasters,wing(wireless inter networking group),techyana,VEEE-sparc\netc. Cultural club,literature club,vruthanth, Rotaract,arivina\nangana and many outreach clubs to cater to the literary & social\nskills required for students.\nc) & d) The institution places great emphasis on providing value-\nbased education to its students, with a focus on inculcating\npositivity, humanistic, ethical, constitutional, and universal human\nvalues as follows:\n1.\nThe institute\u2019s curriculum is designed to incorporate values\nand ethics across all disciplines by inclusion of courses\nlisted below: (i)Universal Human Values - Implications of the\nHolistic Understanding of Harmony on Professional Ethics (ii)\nConstitution of India, Professional Ethics and Cyber Law \u2013 To\nUnderstand engineering ethics and their responsibilities,\nidentify their individual roles and ethical responsibilities\ntowards society. (iii)Social Innovation course designed in the\nfirst year of study, where the students identify the existing\nPage 10/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nlocal social problems and propose a solution for it.\n2.\nThe institute regularly organizes workshops and seminars on\ntopics related to human values, ethics, and social\nresponsibility & encourages students to engage in community\nservice activities through NSS & NCC that promotes social\nresponsibility, empathy, and compassion.\n3.\nThe institution has more than 40 clubs to cater to the\ninterest of students.Few clubs namely Jai ho, outreach clubs,\nVruthanth etc. are aimed at promoting social harmony, empathy,\nand compassion among students by organizing various activities\nsuch as community service initiatives/debates/discussions on\nethical and moral issues, and awareness campaigns.\ne) One of the good practice of the Institute with respect to skill\ndevelopment in view of NEP-2020 is introduction of Engineering\nexploration lab in the first year of curriculum.Similarly many other\ncourses in the all disciplines are being offered with industry\npartners.\n18.Appropriate integration of Indian Knowledge system (teaching in Indian Language, culture,\nusing online course)\nThe integration of Indian knowledge systems into the curriculum is a\ncritical aspect of the National Education Policy 2020. The following\nare the strategies and details regarding the integration of Indian\nknowledge systems into the curriculum:\n1.\nYoga is an integral part of health, wellness, and physical\neducation, which is integrated into the Institute\u2019s second\nyear curriculum, lays special emphasis on the physical and\nemotional well-being of both students and teachers and help\nstudents adopt fitness as a lifelong attitude.\n2.\nInstitute has an Astronomy club that was started in the year\n2018 with a goal to bring all space enthusiasts in one place\nand gain knowledge about astronomy and the amazing space. Many\nhands-on activities, field visits, telescope building\nworkshop, online activities, lectures are conducted regularly.\nThe club has created a platform for space enthusiasts to share\ntheir knowledge and coordinate in astronomy related\nactivities.\n3.\nInstitute offers Internship at the first and second year\nitself, where many activities such as talks from eminent\npersons, seminars/workshops on Indian knowledge system are\nconducted.\n4.\nPromotion of Indian Culture: The institution promotes Indian\nculture through various means, such as cultural events,\nPage 11/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nfestivals, and art exhibitions. Every year Institute organizes\nVIDYUTH- annual cultural extravaganza. The inaugural of the\nevent is marked by blood donation camp followed by various\ncultural and literary programmes organised as part of the\nannual event. The institute also has literature club and\ncultural club. The club organizes reading, debating and\ncreative writing among the students and faculty members. This\nenhances love for languages and creativity which is beyond\nengineering knowledge.\n5.\nKannada Rajyotsava is a colourful celebration in our Institute\nby all age groups, gender, religion, caste and creed and is a\nwholesome and inclusive celebration. The red and yellow flag\nof the state is displayed at all the prominent locations in\nour institute and weeklong activities are conducted to uphold\nour culture, & language.\n6.\nInternational mother language day is also observed in our\nInstitute every year.\n \nInstitute permits its faculty members to provide the classroom\ndelivery in bilingual mode if required & the needy students are\nhelped by teaching in local language separately by the faculty\nmembers during tutorial/remedial hours as it can help bridge the\nlanguage barrier that may be preventing them from fully\nunderstanding the material being taught.\n19.Focus on Outcome based education (OBE):Focus on Outcome based education (OBE):\nOutcome-Based Education(OBE) is a framework for designing and\ndelivering educational programs that focus on the outcomes that\nstudents are expected to achieve. In an OBE framework, the focus is\non what students should be able to do or demonstrate at the end of\nthe learning process, rather than how much time they have spent in\nthe classroom. VVCE emphasizes the student-centered approach that\nfocus on the learning outcomes & following are the learner centric\nmethods adopted in our Institute to strengthen the OBE.\n \n1.\nExperiential Learning\nEngineering exploration lab is set up to introduce interdisciplinary\nexperimental based projects with hands on experience and to arouse\ncuriosity in engineering profession and current technologies that\napply design thinking process. Workshops/industry visits/mini\nPage 12/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nprojects are organized to facilitate the students for practical\nexposure.\n \n1.\nParticipative Learning\nThe Institute encourages a highly conducive T-L environment that\ninvolves students\u2019 participation in activities such as group\ndiscussions/peer tutoring, tutorial classes/flip-classroom/student\nclubs/technical talks/soft skills training/E-\ncell/Techfest/BarCamp/group assignments/crossword\npuzzles/cyberhunt/seminars/quiz/bridge courses/case studies.\nHackathons are organized so that students participate in teams to\nidentify a problem and work collaboratively to create technologies\nthat solve the problem.\n \n1.\n Problem Solving Methodologies: \n \nSocial Innovation course designed in the first year of study is one\nexample of problem-solving methodology where the students identify\nthe existing local social problems and propose a solution for it.\nAnother example is MATLAB Simulation tool introduced for all\nbranches of engineering in the first year itself to help students\nlearn the concepts of mathematics through visualization and to solve\ncomplex mathematical problems.\n \n1.\nVVCE is a part of IUCEE community by having IUCEE Consortium\nMembership. The VVCE IUCEE student chapter aims to aid the\nsociety with emerging technology for sustainable development &\nto encourage students to actively involve in problem and\nproject based learning beyond the classroom.\n2.\nAs a major reform, Activity Based Assessment(ABA) is\nintroduced in all courses to explore its influence on\nstudent's learning outcomes, to assess higher order cognitive\nskills and professional or generic skills which includes\nseminars, surveys, use of modern tools, group discussions,\nopen-ended problem-solving assignments, mini-projects, MOOCs,\npaper publications, activities and other means excluding\nmodule tests and group assignments and also to improve the CO\nPage 13/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nattainment.\n \nGuidelines for effective implementation of OBE in our Institute is\nas follows:\n1.\nHigher order POs can be addressed by incorporating\nexperiential learning/project-based learning in every course.\nEach PO should be addressed at least in 3 or 4 courses.\n2.\nThe weightages for the questions at various blooms level are\nas follows:\nCO1: Understand: weightage 10 to 30%\nCO2: Apply: weightage 30 to 70%\nCO3: Design/ Analysis: weightage 10 to 30 %\n1.\nThe categorization of laboratory experiment should be as\nfollows:\n1.\nDemo experiments\n2.\nExercise experiments\n3.\nStructured enquiry\n4.\nOpen ended experiments\n20.Distance education/online education:\na) Offering vocational courses through Open and Distance Learning\n(ODL) mode can bring flexibility to its learners to study at their\nown pace and convenience where learners may have work or other\ncommitments. However, our Institute is a day college, and it is\nplanned to offer the following courses involving coding such as C,\nC++, Java, Python etc. in ODL mode based on the demand and\navailability of resources.\nOverall, offering vocational courses through ODL mode can help\ninstitutions meet the needs of learners and the job market while\nproviding a flexible and cost-effective way to offer quality\neducation.\n \nb) The development and use of technological tools for teaching and\nlearning activities have become increasingly important in recent\nPage 14/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nyears. Technological tools used for teaching and learning activities\nin our institute include:\n1.\nImpartus lecture capture solution installed in 46 classrooms\nfacilitates record of every lecture delivered by the faculty\nwhich can be viewed by the students any number of times at a\nlater time. This helps slow learners to understand the\ndifficult concepts at their own pace. This also facilitates\nintroduction of flipped classroom teaching where there is only\nlearning in the classroom with little teaching.\n2.\nLearning management systems (LMS): IONLMS is a software\napplication used for lesson plan, upload learning materials,\nattendance marking and assessments. VVCE has developed an in-\nhouse software that has repository of study materials which\nare given as handouts to the students.\n3.\nVirtual learning environments (VLE): One classroom in every\ndepartment is equipped with a smart TV, an online platform\nthat provides students with access to digital learning\nresources, discussion forums, and other collaborative tools.\n4.\nMultimedia content: Our Institute is using multimedia content,\nincluding video lectures, interactive simulations to enhance\nthe learning experience and engage students.\n5.\nSocial media: VVCE has a strong social media connect such as\nFacebook, Twitter, and YouTube to communicate with students,\nshare information, and facilitate discussions.\nInstitutional efforts towards blended learning involve combining\ntraditional classroom instruction with online learning activities.\nThis approach allows students to benefit from the advantages of both\nmodes of learning. Students attend lectures in person and then\naccess additional course materials online. Blended learning also\nallows students to work at their own pace and provides more\nflexibility in terms of scheduling and location.\nVVCE has a very good infrastructure and equipment to support blended\nlearning, such as high-speed internet(1GBPS), computers (2000+), and\naudio-visual equipment.\nOverall, the use of technological tools for teaching and learning\nactivities, as well as institutional efforts towards blended\nlearning, has helped institute to provide a more flexible and\nengaging learning experience for students.\nExtended Profile\n1.Programme\nPage 15/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n1.1\nNumber of programmes offered during the year:\n10\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.Student\n2.1\nTotal number of students during the year:\n3698\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional data in Prescribed format\nView File\n2.2\nNumber of outgoing / final year students during the year:\n934\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.3\nNumber of students who appeared for the examinations conducted\nby the institution during the year:\n952\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.Academic\n3.1\nNumber of courses in all programmes during the year:\n489\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.2\nNumber of full-time teachers during the year:\n230\nPage 16/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.3\nNumber of sanctioned posts for the year:\n230\n4.Institution\n4.1\nNumber of seats earmarked for reserved categories as per\nGOI/State Government during the year:\n298\n4.2\nTotal number of Classrooms and Seminar halls                  \n65\n4.3\nTotal number of computers on campus for academic purposes\n2139\n4.4\nTotal expenditure, excluding salary, during the year (INR in\nLakhs):\n2127.53\nPart B\nCURRICULAR ASPECTS\n1.1 - Curriculum Design and Development\n1.1.1 - Curricula developed and implemented have relevance to the local, national, regional and global\ndevelopmental needs which are reflected in Programme Outcomes (POs), Programme Specific\nOutcomes (PSOs) and Course Outcomes (COs) of the various Programmes offered by the Institution.\nThe curricula developed for all the programs has relevance to the\nlocal, national, regional and global developmental needs and is in\naccordance with the PEOs and POs which are in tune with the\nInstitute\u2019s vision and mission statements. The same is reflected in\nCOs and PSOs which are well defined at the course and the program\nlevel respectively. The Institute follows the curriculum\ndevelopment, revision and implementation procedure systematically as\nrecommended by academic bodies as per UGC/VTU guidelines.\nThe initial phase for ensuring academic quality is the design of the\ncurriculum, in particular, the types of courses, the number of\nPage 17/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:35\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nelectives, and the curricular structure, with complete details of\nthe course title and course contents as per the regulations. The\ncurriculum is divided into eight/four semesters for UG/PG with total\ncredits of 160/100.

It\nwas observed that a lot of students would fail or have low scores in\nmathematics. But, Mathematics is one of the important subjects in\nengineering. Students invariably find the subject challenging and\ndifficult to understand and apply to solve complex engineering\nproblems. Therefore, a conscious decision was taken to introduce the\nlab component for this course from the first semester itself. A\ngroup of mathematics faculty were trained to use Matlab as a\nsimulation tool. It is introduced for all the branches of\nengineering in the first year itself to help students learn the\nconcepts of Mathematics through visualization and also learn to\nsolve complex mathematical problems (which are difficult to solve\nmanually) through MATLAB programming. Students will also learn how\nto solve a problem numerically and to analyze the solution. This\nalso helps students to apply this tool to do simulation for the mini\nPage 70/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:36\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nand major projects at later stages.\nAfter introducing lab component for mathematics, students\nunderstanding of mathematics and love for mathematics has\nsignificantly increased. Even mathematics faculty found it easy to\nmake students understand the difficult mathematical concepts.\nFile Description\nDocuments\nAppropriate link in the\ninstitutional website\n \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HU5KcjqI4I-\nf_UxoncjK6f9IGOBHwAG_/view\nAny other relevant information\nNo File Uploaded\n7.3.2 - Plan of action for the next academic year\nAction plan for next academic year will focus on continuous\nimprovement of the quality of education and services provided by\ntheInstitute.These plans include:\n1.Ensuring Accrediataion & Quality Assurance:\nTo figure in NIRF within 100 ranking \u2013\u201cMission 100\u201d\nTo get NAAC Accreditation with A+ Grade\nTo get NBA accreditation for all the eligible programs for a\nperiod of 6 years.\n2.Curricular aspects:Curriculum design and development in line with\nNEP-2020.\nTo offer additional range of course options,course\ncombinations,certificate,and diploma programmes.\nSustenance of quality through continuing autonomous status.\nAddition of new programmes and strengthening of existing\nprograms.\nIntegration of humanities and science with STEM in curriculum\nto provide opportunities for students to learn and apply\ninterdisciplinary knowledge and skills.\n3.To encourage faculty to complete their PhD at the earliest so\nthat50% of faculty are with PhD qualification.\n4.To attract highly qualified and experienced personnel for faculty\npositions for imparting quality education and skills.\n5.Implementation of ICT/e-governance in all the administrative &\nPage 71/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:36\nSelf Study Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nacademic sections of the Institute.\n6.To inculcate research culture at UG level.\n7.To obtain funds from various funding agencies and publish more\nnumber of patents.\n8.To collaborate with premier universities & foreign universities\nfor faculty & student exchange program.\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nPage 72/72\n30-03-2023 12:06:36"

Multidisciplinary / interdisciplinary: a) One of the long-\nterm goals of the institute as envisaged in the strategic plan is\n\u201cTo become a leading research-focused multidisciplinary private\nuniversity with international collaborations\u201d. To achieve this, a\nlot of efforts/initiatives are taken by the Institute as listed\nbelow: The curriculum formulated in our institute is well\nstructured, enables CBCS implementation, provides Multiple Entry\nMultiple Exit (MEME) options, and incorporates the outcome-based\neducation (OBE) framework. b) As engineering programs have STEM-\nintensive courses, the institute has taken efforts towards the\nintegration of humanities and science with STEM by the\nintroduction of the following courses in the curriculum.\nUniversal Human Values: Implications of the Holistic\nUnderstanding of Harmony on Professional Ethics Constitution of\nIndia, Professional Ethics, and Cyber Law: To understand\nengineering ethics and their responsibilities, identify their\nindividual roles and ethical responsibilities towards society.\nBiology for Engineers: To motivate the students & develop the\ninterdisciplinary vision of biological engineering. The course is\nexpected to encourage engineering students to think about solving\nbiological problems with engineering tools. NSS/Physical\nEducation/Yoga\u2014Introduction of yoga/physical education/NSS in the\ncurriculum has a multitude of benefits for students, as it will\nhave a positive impact on academic performance. Social Innovation\ncourse designed in the first year of study, where the students\nidentify the existing local social problems and propose a\nsolution for it. c) & d) Multiple Entry and Multiple Exit (MEME):\nThe multiple entry and exit points in the academic programs would\nremove rigid boundaries and create new possibilities for\nstudents. To facilitate flexible learning within the stipulated\nPage 14/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:32\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nperiod (eight years for regular students and six years for\nlateral entry students), multiple-entry and multiple-exit options\nare offered to needy students. While earning credits towards\ntheir B.E. degree, the students may judiciously use the options\nprovided to them through CBCS and MEME clauses in the Regulations\nto obtain additional certificates after two years and a B.Sc.\ndegree in engineering after three years. However, they shall earn\nthe required credits for the award of the degree within the\nmaximum specified duration. e) & f) One of the good practices of\nour Institute is the implementation of a flexible and\ncustomizable curriculum by offering electives in all the years of\nstudy that allows students to take courses from different\ndisciplines, thereby promoting a multidisciplinary approach. This\nalso allows students to choose courses that are aligned with\ntheir interests and career aspirations. The institution also\nencourages project-/problem-based learning, which involves\nstudents working on real-world problems that require input from\nmultiple disciplines. This approach promotes collaboration and\ninterdisciplinary learning as students work together to find\nsolutions to complex problems. Internships are offered in the\nfirst and second years itself to provide an opportunity for\nstudents to gain practical, hands-on experience in their chosen\nfield and build their resumes. Industry-relevant electives are\noffered that help students gain practical knowledge and skills\nthat are directly applicable to their chosen careers. Also,\nadjunct faculty from industries are appointed to teach these\ncourses so that students can gain insights into current trends,\nchallenges, and opportunities.\n16.Academic bank of credits (ABC):\na) & b) The UGC has been working to promote the adoption of the\nABC system by institutions across India and has developed\nguidelines and frameworks to support its implementation. The\nInstitute has already registered with National Academic\nDepositary (NAD) and is in the process of registering with the\nAcademic Bank of Credits (ABC) as and when the facility is\noffered by the Ministry of Education, Government of India. \nHowever, our institute has already started offering credit-based\ncourses. Offering Credit-Based Courses: The institution offers\ncredit-based courses that allow students to earn credits for\ncompleting assignments, projects, and exams. This approach\nprovides students with more flexibility and control for the\ntransfer of credits from one institution to another using ABC. c)\nThe institution is making efforts to collaborate with several\nreputed foreign universities and institutions to offer joint\nPage 15/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:32\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nprograms and research opportunities to facilitate the exchange of\nknowledge, expertise, and resources and promote the\ninternationalization of education. d) The institution encourages\nits faculty members to design their own curricular and\npedagogical approaches within the approved teaching-learning\nframework as follows: Autonomy: The institution provides academic\nautonomy to its faculty members to design their own courses,\nselect textbooks, reading materials, assignments, and\nassessments, which has enabled our faculty members to innovate\nand experiment with new pedagogical approaches. Faculty\nDevelopment Programs (FDP): The institution conducts regular FDPs\nto provide faculty members with training and support in designing\nand implementing new pedagogical approaches. These programs help\nfaculty members to upgrade their skills, enhance their knowledge,\nand adopt best practices in teaching and learning. The\ninstitution has a College Academic Affairs Committee (CAAC) that\nreviews and approves course proposals submitted by faculty\nmembers. This committee provides feedback and suggestions to\nfaculty members on how to improve their courses and align them\nwith the institution's overall academic goals and objectives. The\ninstitution has assessment policies given by the College\nAccreditation Committee (CAC) that provide guidelines and\nstandards for evaluating student learning outcomes. Feedback\nMechanisms: The institution has feedback mechanisms that enable\nstudents to provide feedback on the curriculum & quality of\nteaching and learning in their courses. Faculty members use this\nfeedback to evaluate the effectiveness of their pedagogical\napproaches and make necessary adjustments to improve student\nlearning outcomes. Centre for Creative Teaching & Learning\n(CCTL): Our institute has an active Centre for Creative Teaching\n& Learning with an objective to explore innovative teaching-\nlearning techniques, practice them, and share their merits and\napplicability among faculty members. Provision is also made on\nthe Institute website about various methods/innovations of\nteaching-learning and to give feedback/suggestions/critique. This\ncommittee meets regularly, discusses various methods and their\neffectiveness, and shares with other faculty members during\nmonthly faculty interaction meetings. The feedback on teaching-\nlearning has significantly increased in the last couple of years\ndue to the successful implementation of T-L techniques, which are\nsuggested by CCTL.\n17.Skill development:\na) & b) The institute has taken several efforts to strengthen the\nvocational education and soft skills of students in alignment\nPage 16/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:32\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nwith the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF). Some of\nthe key initiatives are: Institute has set up an Indian Society\nfor Heating, Refrigerating, and Airconditioning  Engineers\n(ISHRAE) showcase in association with industries, which is first\nof its kind in south India to provide vocational training in\nrefrigeration & air conditioning  to the candidates of Mysuru\nregion. In addition, it conducts seminars/talks/workshops for\nskill development of our students. Curriculum Alignment: Skill\ndevelopment courses are integral part of our Institute\u2019s\ncurriculum to nurture student proficiency skills. Ability\nEnhancement Courses (AE) are the generic skill courses which are\nbasic and needed to all to ensure progression across all careers.\nThe institute has established strong industry collaborations to\nprovide students with hands-on training and work experience. The\nInstitute has MOUs with Holosuit, Harappa education, LTTS,\nVivarthan, Dassault and many more. The institute encourage\nstudents to take up, (i) an interdisciplinary Research Internship\nor Industry internship and (ii) a rural internship, a work-based\nactivity carried out to learn practical experiences in rural\nareas, for the upliftment of living standards. 5.The institute\noffers soft skills training programs to develop students'\ninterpersonal skills, communication skills, and leadership skills\nright from first semester. 6.Institute has more than 40 Student\nclubs for overall development of student community. To foster\nentrepreneurial, leadership, communication & technical skills we\nhave E-Cell, toast masters, wing(wireless inter networking\ngroup), techyana, VEEE-sparc etc. Cultural club, literature club,\nvruthanth, Rotaract, arivina angana and many outreach clubs to\ncater to the literary & social skills required for students.   c)\n& d) The institution places great emphasis on providing value-\nbased education to its students, with a focus on inculcating\npositivity and humanistic, ethical, constitutional, and universal\nhuman values as follows: The institute\u2019s curriculum is designed\nto incorporate values and ethics across all disciplines by\nincluding the courses listed below: Universal Human Values:\nImplications of the Holistic Understanding of Harmony on\nProfessional Ethics Constitution of India, Professional Ethics,\nand Cyber Law To understand engineering ethics and their\nresponsibilities, identify their individual roles and ethical\nresponsibilities towards society. The social innovation course is\ndesigned in the first year of study, where the students identify\nthe existing local social problems and propose a solution for\nthem. The institute regularly organizes workshops and seminars on\ntopics related to human values, ethics, and social responsibility\n& encourages students to engage in community service activities\nthrough NSS & NCC that promote social responsibility, empathy,\nPage 17/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:32\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nand compassion. The institution has more than 40 clubs to cater\nto the interests of students. Few clubs, namely Jai Ho, outreach\nclubs, Vruthanth, etc., are aimed at promoting social harmony,\nempathy, and compassion among students by organizing various\nactivities such as community service initiatives, debates,\ndiscussions on ethical and moral issues, and awareness campaigns.\ne) One of the good practices of the institute with respect to\nskill development in view of NEP-2020 is the introduction of an\nengineering exploration lab in the first year of the curriculum.\nSimilarly, many other courses in all disciplines are being\noffered with industry partners.\n18.Appropriate integration of Indian Knowledge system (teaching in Indian Language,\nculture, using online course)\nThe integration of Indian knowledge systems into the curriculum\nis a critical aspect of the National Education Policy 2020. The\nfollowing are the strategies and details regarding the\nintegration of Indian knowledge systems into the curriculum: Yoga\nis an integral part of health, wellness, and physical education,\nwhich is integrated into the Institute\u2019s second-year curriculum.\nIt lays special emphasis on the physical and emotional well-being\nof both students and teachers and helps students adopt fitness as\na lifelong attitude. The institute has an astronomy club that was\nstarted in the year 2018 with a goal to bring all space\nenthusiasts in one place and gain knowledge about astronomy and\nthe amazing space. Many hands-on activities, field visits,\ntelescope-building workshops, online activities, and lectures are\nconducted regularly. The club has created a platform for space\nenthusiasts to share their knowledge and coordinate astronomy-\nrelated activities. The institute offers internships in the first\nand second years itself, where many activities, such as talks\nfrom eminent persons and seminars/workshops on the Indian\nknowledge system, are conducted. Promotion of Indian Culture: The\ninstitution promotes Indian culture through various means, such\nas cultural events, festivals, and art exhibitions. Every year,\nthe institute organizes VIDYUTH\u2014an annual cultural extravaganza.\nThe inauguration of the event is marked by a blood donation camp\nfollowed by various cultural and literary programs organized as\npart of the annual event. The institute also has a literature\nclub and a cultural club. The club organizes reading, debate, and\ncreative writing among the students and faculty members. This\nenhances love for languages and creativity, which is beyond\nengineering knowledge. Kannada Rajyotsava is a colorful\ncelebration in our institute for all age groups, gender,\nreligion, caste, and creed and is a wholesome and inclusive\nPage 18/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\ncelebration. The red and yellow flag of the state is displayed at\nall the prominent locations in our institute, and weeklong\nactivities are conducted to uphold our culture & language.\nInternational Mother Language Day is also observed in our\ninstitute every year.   The institute permits its faculty members\nto provide the classroom delivery in bilingual mode if required,\n& the needy students are helped by teaching in local language\nseparately by the faculty members during tutorial/remedial hours,\nas it can help bridge the language barrier that may be preventing\nthem from fully understanding the material being taught.\n19.Focus on Outcome based education (OBE):Focus on Outcome based education (OBE):\nOutcome-Based Education (OBE) is a framework for designing and\ndelivering educational programs that focus on the outcomes that\nstudents are expected to achieve. In an OBE framework, the focus\nis on what students should be able to do or demonstrate at the\nend of the learning process, rather than how much time they have\nspent in the classroom. VVCE emphasizes the student-centered\napproach that focuses on the learning outcomes, & the following\nare the learner-centric methods adopted in our institute to\nstrengthen the OBE. 1. Experiential Learning The engineering\nexploration lab is set up to introduce interdisciplinary,\nexperimental-based projects with hands-on experience and to\narouse curiosity in the engineering profession and current\ntechnologies that apply the design thinking process. Workshops,\nindustry visits, and mini projects are organized to facilitate\nthe students' practical exposure. 2. Participative Learning The\ninstitute encourages a highly conducive T-L environment that\ninvolves students\u2019 participation in activities such as group\ndiscussions/peer tutoring, tutorial classes/flip-\nclassroom/student clubs/technical talks/soft skills training/E-\ncell/Techfest/BarCamp/group assignments/crossword\npuzzles/cyberhunt/seminars/quiz/bridge courses/case studies.\nHackathons are organized so that students participate in teams to\nidentify a problem and work collaboratively to create\ntechnologies that solve the problem. 3. Problem-\nsolving Methodologies: The Social Innovation course designed in\nthe first year of study is one example of problem-solving\nmethodology where the students identify the existing local social\nproblems and propose a solution for them. Another example is the\nMATLAB simulation tool introduced for all branches of engineering\nin the first year itself to help students learn the concepts of\nmathematics through visualization and to solve complex\nmathematical problems. 4. VVCE is a part of the IUCEE community\nby having IUCEE Consortium membership. The VVCE IUCEE student\nPage 19/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nchapter aims to aid society with emerging technology for\nsustainable development & to encourage students to actively\ninvolve in problem- and project-based learning beyond the\nclassroom. 5. As a major reform, Activity Based Assessment (ABA)\nis introduced in all courses to explore its influence on\nstudents' learning outcomes, to assess higher-order cognitive\nskills and professional or generic skills, which include\nseminars, surveys, use of modern tools, group discussions, open-\nended problem-solving assignments, mini-projects, MOOCs, paper\npublications, activities, and other means excluding module tests\nand group assignments, and also to improve CO attainment.\nGuidelines for effective implementation of OBE in our institute\nis as follows: Higher-order POs can be addressed by incorporating\nexperiential learning/project-based learning in every course.\nEach PO should be addressed at least in 3 or 4 courses. The\nweightages for the questions at various levels are as follows:\nCO1: Understand: weightage 10 to 30% CO2: Apply: weightage 30 to\n70% CO3: Design/Analysis: weightage 10 to 30 % The categorization\nof laboratory experiments should be as follows: Demo experiments\nExercise experiments Structured enquiry Open-ended experiments\n20.Distance education/online education:\na) Offering vocational courses through Open and Distance Learning\n(ODL) mode can bring flexibility to its learners to study at\ntheir own pace and convenience where learners may have work or\nother commitments. However, our institute is a day college, and\nit is planned to offer the following courses involving coding,\nsuch as C, C++, Java, Python, etc., in ODL mode based on the\ndemand and availability of resources. Overall, offering\nvocational courses through ODL mode can help institutions meet\nthe needs of learners and the job market while providing a\nflexible and cost-effective way to offer quality education. b)\nThe development and use of technological tools for teaching and\nlearning activities have become increasingly important in recent\nyears. Technological tools used for teaching and learning\nactivities in our institute include: The Impartus lecture capture\nsolution installed in 46 classrooms facilitates a record of every\nlecture delivered by the faculty, which can be viewed by the\nstudents any number of times at a later time. This helps slow\nlearners to understand the difficult concepts at their own pace.\nThis also facilitates the introduction of flipped classroom\nteaching, where there is only learning in the classroom with\nlittle teaching. Learning management systems (LMS): ION LMS is a\nsoftware application used for lesson planning, uploading learning\nmaterials, attendance marking, and assessments. VVCE has\nPage 20/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\ndeveloped in-house software that has a repository of study\nmaterials that are given as handouts to the students. Virtual\nlearning environments (VLE): One classroom in every department is\nequipped with a smart TV, an online platform that provides\nstudents with access to digital learning resources, discussion\nforums, and other collaborative tools. Multimedia content: Our\ninstitute is using multimedia content, including video lectures\nand interactive simulations, to enhance the learning experience\nand engage students. Social media: VVCE has a strong social media\nconnect such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to communicate\nwith students, share information, and facilitate discussions.\nInstitutional efforts towards blended learning involve combining\ntraditional classroom instruction with online learning\nactivities. This approach allows students to benefit from the\nadvantages of both modes of learning. Students attend lectures in\nperson and then access additional course materials online.\nBlended learning also allows students to work at their own pace\nand provides more flexibility in terms of scheduling and\nlocation. VVCE has very good infrastructure and equipment to\nsupport blended learning, such as high-speed internet (1 GBPS),\ncomputers (2000+), and audio-visual equipment. Overall, the use\nof technological tools for teaching and learning activities, as\nwell as institutional efforts towards blended learning, has\nhelped the institute provide a more flexible and engaging\nlearning experience for students.\nExtended Profile\n1.Programme\n1.1\nNumber of programmes offered during the year:\n10\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.Student\n2.1\nTotal number of students during the year:\n4215\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional data in Prescribed format\nView File\nPage 21/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n2.2\nNumber of outgoing / final year students during the year:\n954\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.3\nNumber of students who appeared for the examinations\nconducted by the institution during the year:\n1028\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.Academic\n3.1\nNumber of courses in all programmes during the year:\n609\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.2\nNumber of full-time teachers during the year:\n240\nPage 22/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nExtended Profile\n1.Programme\n1.1\nNumber of programmes offered during the year:\n10\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.Student\n2.1\nTotal number of students during the year:\n4215\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional data in Prescribed format\nView File\n2.2\nNumber of outgoing / final year students during the year:\n954\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n2.3\nNumber of students who appeared for the examinations\nconducted by the institution during the year:\n1028\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.Academic\n3.1\nNumber of courses in all programmes during the year:\n609\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\nPage 23/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n3.2\nNumber of full-time teachers during the year:\n240\nFile Description\nDocuments\nInstitutional Data in Prescribed Format\nView File\n3.3\nNumber of sanctioned posts for the year:\n240\n4.Institution\n4.1\nNumber of seats earmarked for reserved categories as per\nGOI/State Government during the year:\n380\n4.2\nTotal number of Classrooms and Seminar halls                  \n98\n4.3\nTotal number of computers on campus for academic purposes\n2553\n4.4\nTotal expenditure, excluding salary, during the year (INR in\nLakhs):\n6577.27\nPart B\nCURRICULAR ASPECTS\n1.1 - Curriculum Design and Development\n1.1.1 - Curricula developed and implemented have relevance to the local, national, regional and\nglobal developmental needs which are reflected in Programme Outcomes (POs), Programme\nSpecific Outcomes (PSOs) and Course Outcomes (COs) of the various Programmes offered by\nthe Institution.\nVVCE adheres to outcome-based education, periodically\nrevising the curriculum that has relevance with local,\nregional, national, and international needs, adhering to\nthe Program Educational Objectives and Program Outcomes in\nline with the institute\u2019s vision and mission.\nThese are reflected in the well-defined course outcomes\nand program-specific outcomes at the course and program\nPage 24/145\n19-06-2025 10:54:33\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\nlevels.\nCurriculum development, revision, and implementation\nfollow systematic procedures recommended by academic\nbodies such as the Board of Studies (BOS) and Academic\nCouncil as per UGC/VTU guidelines.\nThe curriculum is framed by adopting the suggestions by\nindustry experts and alumni and looking into the syllabi\nof various competitive exams like GATE, IES, etc.\nThe curriculum emphasizes academic quality through a\nstructured design, which includes\nEmployability-enhancing modules\nSkill-development courses\nIndustry internships\nMini projects\nOnline learning\nMandatory humanities and social sciences courses, which\ncultivate awareness of self, family, and society.\nProfessional Electives catering to industry needs are\noffered, such as cybersecurity and Forensics, UI/UX\nDesign, finances, etc.\nIndustry-driven add-on courses are offered to pre-final-\nyear students in all departments.

Selection: if, switch (also called conditional statements) \n2. Iteration: while, for, do-while (also called loops) \n3. Jump: break, continue, goto, return \n4. Label: case, default, and label statements \n5. Expression: statements that are valid expressions \n6. Block: code blocks enclosed in { } (also called compound statements) \nSelection Statements: \n\uf0b7 \nC has two selection statements: if and switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ? (ternary) operator is an alternative to if in some cases. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral form of if statement: \n \n\uf0b7 \nA statement can be a single statement, a block of statements, or empty. \n\uf0b7 \nThe else part is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the expression is true (non-zero), the if block executes. \n\uf0b7 \nOtherwise, the else block executes if present. \n\uf0b7 \nOnly one block runs: either if or else, never both. \n \nExample : \nWrite a C program to guess the magic number \n\n \n2 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe program is a simple \"guess the magic number\" game. It prints Right if the player \nguesses correctly. The magic number is generated using rand() from <stdlib.h>, which \nreturns a number between 0 and RAND_MAX (at least 32,767). The next version uses \nan else statement to print a message for a wrong guess. \n \n \nNested ifs \n\uf0b7 \nA nested if is an if statement inside another if or else. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs are common in programming. \n\uf0b7 \nAn else always matches the nearest if in the same block without an else. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner else pairs with its nearest if. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs can improve the magic number game by giving feedback on wrong guesses as \nshown in the program below, \n\n \n3 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nThe if-else-if Ladder \nA common programming construct is the if-else-if ladder, sometimes called the if-else-if staircase \nbecause of its appearance. Its general form is \n          \n \n\uf0b7 \nConditions are checked from top to bottom. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a true condition is found, its associated statement runs. \n\uf0b7 \nThe rest of the conditions are skipped after that. \n\uf0b7 \nIf no condition is true, the final else runs. \n\uf0b7 \nIf there is no final else and all conditions fail, no action happens. \n\n \n4 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nUsing an if-else-if ladder, the magic number program becomes as follows: \n \n \n \nThe ? Alternative  \nHere\u2019s a simple breakdown of the ternary (?) operator: \n\uf0b7 \nIt replaces simple if-else assignment statements: \n \n\uf0b7 The general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nHow it works: \n\uf0b7 \nEvaluate Exp1 (the condition). \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, value is Exp2. \n\uf0b7 \nIf false, value is Exp3. \n\uf0b7 \nIt\u2019s called ternary because it has three parts (operands). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: if x >= 9, then y = 100, else y = 200. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is equivalent to a simple if-else assigning y based on x. \nUsing the ? operator, you can rewrite the magic number program yet again, In the magic number \nprogram below , the ? operator displays the proper message based on the outcome of the test guess \n> magic. \n \n\n \n5 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe Conditional Expression \n\uf0b7 \nIn C, any valid expression can control an if or ? operator. \n\uf0b7 \nExpressions don\u2019t have to use only relational or logical operators. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression just needs to evaluate to true (nonzero) or false (0). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: a program reads two integers and shows their quotient. \n\uf0b7 \nIt uses if to check the second number to prevent divide-by-zero errors. \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is 0, the if condition is false, so else runs. \n\n \n6 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is nonzero, the if condition is true, and division happens. \n\uf0b7 \nWriting if (b != 0) instead of if (b) is redundant and less efficient. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing just if (b) is clearer and better style. \nSwitch \n\uf0b7 \nC provides a multiple-branch selection statement called switch. \n\uf0b7 \nIt tests an expression\u2019s value against several integer or character constants. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the corresponding statements run. \n\uf0b7 \nThe general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe switch expression must be an integer type (integer or character), not floating-point. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression\u2019s value is compared one-by-one to each case constant. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the associated statements run until a break or the end of the switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe default case runs if no matches are found; it is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nbreak jumps execution out of the switch to the next line after it. \n\uf0b7 \nKey points about switch: \n\uf0b7 \nOnly tests equality, unlike if which can test any condition. \n\uf0b7 \nCase constants must be unique within a switch. \n\uf0b7 \nCharacter cases convert automatically to integers. \n\uf0b7 \nswitch is often used for handling keyboard commands or menu choices. \nAs shown here, the function menu( ) displays a menu for a spelling-checker program and calls the \nproper procedures: \n\n \n7 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe break statement in a switch is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf break is omitted, execution falls through to the next case\u2019s statements. \n\uf0b7 \nThis \"fall through\" continues until a break or the end of the switch is reached. \n\uf0b7 \nThis behavior can simplify code by letting multiple cases share code in a single block. \n\uf0b7 \nWithout a break, cases below the matched case will also run, which can be intentional or \ncause errors if unintentional. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing break is important to stop execution after the matched case block. \nNested switch Statements  \n\uf0b7 \nou can have a switch inside another switch; the inner switch is part of the outer switch's \nstatement sequence. \n\uf0b7 \nThe outer and inner switches can have case constants with the same values without \nconflict. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner switch executes only when the outer switch matches its case that contains the \ninner switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThis allows handling complex decisions with nested conditions. \n\n \n8 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nIteration Statements \nIn C , iteration statements (also called loops) allow a set of instructions to be repeatedly \nexecuted until a certain condition is reached. This condition may be predetermined (as in the for \nloop) or open ended (as in the while and do-while loops). \nfor Loop in C  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop repeats a set of instructions multiple times. \n\uf0b7 \nIt works by entering a loop and running code while a condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral syntax: \n \n\uf0b7 \nInitialization sets the loop variable once at the start. \n\uf0b7 \nCondition is checked before each loop iteration; if false, the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nIncrement updates the loop variable after each iteration. \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop continues while the condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce false, execution moves to the code after the loop. \nIn the following program, a for loop is used to print the numbers 1 through 100 on the screen: \n \n\n \n9 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop initializes xx to 1. \n\uf0b7 \nIt checks if xx is less than or equal to 100. \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, it runs the printf() statement. \n\uf0b7 \nAfter printing, xx is increased by 1. \n\uf0b7 \nThe condition is checked again for the updated xx. \n\uf0b7 \nThis repeats until xx becomes greater than 100. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce x>100x>100, the loop terminates and the program continues. \n\uf0b7 \nx is called the loop control variable because it controls loop execution by changing and \nbeing tested each time. \n\uf0b7 \nIn for loops, the conditional test is always performed at the top of the loop. This means \nthat the code inside the loop may not be executed at all if the condition is false to begin \nwith. \nfor Loop Variations \n1)The comma operator allows multiple variables to be controlled in a single for loop. \n\uf0b7 \nYou can initialize and update more than one variable within the for statement using \ncommas. \n \n\uf0b7 \nHere, variables x and y initialized together in the for statement. \n\uf0b7 \nEach loop iteration increments x and updates y with input from the keyboard. \n\uf0b7 \nBoth x and y need correct values for the loop to stop. \n\uf0b7 \ny must be initialized (e.g., y=0) before the loop so its value is defined at the start. \n2)The initialization and increment parts of the for loop can contain any valid expressions or \nfunction calls, not just simple variable updates.  \n\n \n10 \nModule 2 : Statements \nThe C program below demonstrates the same, \n \n \n3)Another interesting trait of the for loop is that pieces of the loop definition need not be there. \n\u2014 the expressions are optional. For example, this loop will run until the user enters 123: \n \nThe Infinite Loop  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop can create an infinite loop by leaving the condition empty. \n \n\uf0b7 \nSince no condition is given, the loop never ends naturally. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is a traditional way to write an endless loop in C. \n\n \n11 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop runs forever until externally stopped or broken with a statement like break. \n \nThe while Loop \nThe general form of the while loop is , \n \nThe C program below demonstrates the use of the while loop, \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nch is initialized to null before the while loop starts. \n\uf0b7 \nThe while loop continues as long as ch is not equal to 'A'. \n\uf0b7 \nSince ch starts as null, the loop condition is true initially and the loop runs. \n\uf0b7 \nEach time you press a key, ch updates, and the condition is checked again. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen you enter 'A', the condition becomes false; the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nwhile loops check the test condition at the top of the loop,the body of the loop will not \nexecute if the condition is false to begin with. \nThe do-while Loop \n\uf0b7 Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do-\nwhile loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.  \n\uf0b7 This means that a do-while loop always executes at least once. \n\uf0b7 The general form of the do-while loop is , \n \n\n \n12 \nModule 2 : Statements \nFor Example , The following do-while loop will read numbers from the keyboard until it finds a \nnumber less than or equal to 100: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe do-while loop is ideal for menu selection because it runs the menu at least once. \n\uf0b7 \nThe menu displays options and waits for the user\u2019s choice. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is valid, it returns that choice and exits the loop. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is invalid, the loop repeats and prompts the user again. \n\uf0b7 \nThis guarantees the menu shows repeatedly until a valid option is selected. \n\uf0b7 \nThe condition is checked after showing the menu, so the menu always appears at least \nonce. \n\uf0b7 \nThis approach makes input validation and user interactions simple and clear. \nJump Statements \n\uf0b7 \nC has four unconditional branch statements: return, goto, break, and continue. \n\uf0b7 \nreturn and goto can be used anywhere inside a function. \n\uf0b7 \nbreak and continue are used inside loops (for, while, do-while). \n 1)The return Statement \n        The general form of the return statement is, \n             \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe return statement ends the execution of a function. \n\uf0b7 \nIt causes the program to jump back to the point where the function was called. \n\uf0b7 \nA return may or may not include a value. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the function has a non-void return type (e.g., int, float), return must return a value of \nthat type. \n\uf0b7 \nThe returned value becomes the function's output to the caller. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the function has a void return type, return is used without a value to exit the function \nearly. \n\n \n13 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nAny code after a return statement in a function is not executed. \n2) The goto Statement \n     The general form of the goto statement is, \n        \n \n\uf0b7 The goto statement requires a label for operation. (A label is a valid identifier followed \nby a colon.)  \n\uf0b7 Furthermore, the label must be in the same function as the goto that uses it\u2014 you cannot \njump between functions. \n\uf0b7 For Example, you could create a loop from 1 to 100 using the goto and a label, as shown \nhere \n \n \n3) The break Statement \n\uf0b7 \nThe break statement has two main uses: \n1. To end a case in a switch statement. \n2. To immediately terminate a loop (for, while, do-while), skipping the remaining \niterations. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen encountered inside a loop, break stops the loop right away. \n\uf0b7 \nControl resumes at the first statement after the loop. \n\uf0b7 \nIn a switch, break stops falling through to subsequent cases. \n\uf0b7 \nWithout break in a switch, execution continues to the next case until a break or switch \nend. \n\uf0b7 \nbreak only exits the innermost loop or switch containing it. \n\n \n14 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nIt is often used with an if condition inside loops to decide when to exit early. \nFor Example, \n \nHere the above program, prints the numbers 0 through 10 on the screen. Then the loop \nterminates because break causes immediate exit from the loop, overriding the conditional test \nt<100. \n4) The continue Statement  \n\uf0b7 The continue statement works somewhat like the break statement. \n\uf0b7 Instead of forcing termination, however, continue forces the next iteration of the loop to \ntake place, skipping any code in between. \n\uf0b7 For the for loop, continue causes the increment and then the conditional test portions of \nthe loop to execute. \n\uf0b7 Each character is tested to see if it is a space.If it is not, the continue statement forces \nthe for to iterate again. If the character is a space, space is incremented. \n\n \n15 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nExpression Statements \n\uf0b7 expression statement is simply a valid expression followed by a semicolon, as in the \nexample below \n           \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe first expression statement can be a function call that performs a task. \n\uf0b7 \nThe second is an assignment statement, which sets a variable's value. \n\uf0b7 \nThe third expression may look strange but is still evaluated because the function it calls \nmight have important effects. \nBlock Statements \n\uf0b7 \nBlock statements group several statements into a single unit. \n\uf0b7 \nThey are also called compound statements. \n\uf0b7 \nA block starts with { and ends with }. \n\uf0b7 \nBlocks logically bind related statements together. \n\uf0b7 \nBlocks are often used to group multiple statements as one statement for conditions \nlike if or loops. \n\n \n16 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nYou can use a block anywhere a single statement is allowed. \n\uf0b7 \nBlocks create a local scope for variables declared inside them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \nModule 2 : Statements"

In 1938, Claude E. Shannon (MIT, USA), in his classical paper\nentitled\" A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits\" in the Truncations of AIEE, has devel-\noped the algebra of switching  functions  and showed how its structure is related  to the ideas\nestablished by  Boole. This is a classical example of how an abstract mathematics in the 19th century\nbecame an applied mathematical discipline in the 20th century. Such is the power of mathematics , the\nqueen of sciences. In my view the aim of Engineering Mathematics is to make the student think\nmathematically and develop \u001bmathematical maturity\".\nThe need for a good text book on \u001bEngineering Mathematics\" for students of engineering  and\ntechnology in India can be easily understood.  Although several books are available, almost none of\nthem have the right combination , simplicity , rig our,   pedagogy  and syllabus compatibility , dealing\nwith all aspects of the course.

Chebyshev-polynomials which are\nuseful in approximation theory are also presented.\nAlgebraic function f (x) is obtained by the alge-\nbraic operations of addition, subtraction, multipli-\ncation, division and square rooting of x polynomial\nand rational functions are such functions. Transcen-\ndental functions include trigonometric functions\n(sine, cosine, tan) exponential, logarithmic and\nhyperbolic functions.\nAlgebraic and transcendental functions together\nconstitute the elementary functions. Special func-\ntions (or higher functions) are functions other than\nthe elementary functions such as Gamma, Beta func-\ntions (expressed as integrals) Bessel\u2019s functions,\nLegendre polynomials (as solutions of ordinary dif-\nferential equations). Special functions also include\nLaguerre, Hermite, Chebyshev polynomials, error\nfunction, sine integral, exponential integral, Fresnel\nintegrals, etc.\nMany integrals which can not be expressed in\nterms of elementary functions can be evaluated in\nterms of beta and gamma functions.\nHeat equation, wave equation and Laplace\u2019s equa-\ntionwithcylindricalsymmetrycanbesolvedinterms\nof Bessel\u2019s functions, with spherical symmetry by\nLegendre polynomials.\n11.1\nGAMMA FUNCTION\nGamma function denoted by  (p) is de\ufb01ned by\nthe improper integral which is dependent on the\nparameter p,\n (p) =\n\u0001 \u221e\n0\ne\u2212ttp\u22121 dt,\n(p > 0)\n(1)\nGamma function is also known as Euler\u2019s integral of\nthe second kind.\nIntegrating by parts\n (p + 1) =\n\u0001 \u221e\n0\ne\u2212ttp dt\n= \u2212e\u2212ttp \u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u221e\n0 + p\n\u0001 \u221e\n0\ne\u2212ttp\u22121 dt\n= 0 + p (p)\nThus\n (p + 1) = p (p)\n(2)\n(2) is known as the functional relation or reduction\nor recurrence formula for gamma function.\nResult:\n (n + a) = (n + a \u22121)(n + a \u22122)(n + a \u22123) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\na \u00b7  (a), n is integer.\nBy de\ufb01nition\n (1) =\n\u0001 \u221e\n0\ne\u2212t dt = e\u2212t\n\u22121\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u221e\n0\n= 1\n(3)\nBy the reduction formula (2),\n (2) = 1 \u00b7  (1) = 1\nand\n (3) = 2 \u00b7  (2) = 2 \u00b7 1 = 2!\nand in general when p is a positive integer n\n (n + 1) = n (n) = n(n \u22121)  (n \u22121)\n= n(n \u22121)(n \u22122)  (n \u22122)\n= n \u00b7 (n \u22121)(n \u22122) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 1 = n!\n11.1\n3.20\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nFind the degree of the following\nhomogeneous functions:\na. x2 \u22122xy + y2\nd. x\n1\n3 y\u22124\n3 tan\u22121(y/x)\nb. log y \u2212log x\ne. 3x2yz + 5xy2z + 4x4\nc.

Vector Algebra and Ana-\nlytical Solid Geometry are prerequisites for Vector\nDifferential Calculus of Chapter 15 and 16. The the-\nory of equations deals with the analytical solutions of\ncubic and quartic equations while several numerical\nmethods for solutions of algebraic and transcenden-\ntal equations are considered in the Chapter 32 on\nNumerical Analysis. Complex numbers is the intro-\nductory part for the complex function theory dealt in\nChapters 22, 23, 24 and 25.\n1.1\nVECTOR ALGEBRA\nVectors are very useful in engineering mathematics\nsince many rules of vector calculation are as simple\nas that of real numbers and is a shorthand simplifying\nseveral calculations.\nVector analysis was introduced by Gibbs.*\nScalars are physical quantities which possess only\nmagnitude and are completely de\ufb01ned by a single\nreal number.\nExamples: Mass, temperature, volume, kinetic en-\nergy, salinity, length, voltage, time, work, electric\ncharge.\nVectors are physical quantities which possess both\nmagnitude and direction. Thus geometrically vectors\nare directed line segment (or an arrow) which are\ndetermined completely by their magnitude (length)\nand direction.\nExamples: Force, velocity, acceleration, momen-\ntum, displacement, weight.\nVectors are denoted by lower case bold face type\nletters a or by an arrow overhead the letter as  a or a.\n* Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), American mathematician.\n1.1\n\n1.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014I\nA vector a depicted as an arrow (directed line seg-\nment) has a tail A known as the initial point (or ori-\ngin) and a tip B known as the terminal point (or\nterminus).\nThe magnitude (or absolute value) of a vector a\n(length of the directed line segment) is denoted by\n|a| or a (non bold face). It is also known as norm (or\nEuclidean norm) of a.\nUnit vector is a vector of unit magnitude (i.e., of\nlength 1). If a is any vector of non zero magnitude\n(a  = 0), then a\na is a unit vector in the direction of\na i.e., a unit vector is obtained by dividing it by its\nmagnitude.\nZero (or null) vector is a vector of zero magnitude\nand has no speci\ufb01ed direction.\nEquality: Two vectors a and b are said to be equal,\ndenoted as a = b, if both a and b have the same\nmagnitude and same direction without regard to their\ninitial points (also known as free\u2217vectors). Thus a\nvector can be moved parallel to itself without any\nchange.\nNegative of a vector a, denoted by \u2212a, is a vector\nhaving the same magnitude as a but having opposite\ndirection.\nNote:\nLength of \u2212a is not negative.\na\u2013\nb\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\na\u2013\nb\nb\n\u2013\n\u2013\na\na\n\u2013\n\u2013\nk a\nb\n=\n\u2013\n\u2013\na\nb\n=\n\u2013\n\u2013\na\nb\n= \u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nb\nk\n=\na\na\nb\n\u00b9\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 1.2\nScalar multiplication \u03b1a is a vector of magnitude\n|\u03b1|a and having the same direction of a, if \u03b1 > 0\nand of opposite direction if \u03b1 < 0.\n* In contrast, bound vectors are \ufb01xed vectors and are restricted\nto their initial points (such as application of force at a point).\nHere |\u03b1| is the absolute value of the scalar \u03b1.\nUnequal: a, b, are said to be unequal, written as\na  = b when magnitudes of a and b are different or\ndirection of a and b or both magnitudes and direction\nof a and b are different.\nIn vector algebra, addition, subtraction and multi-\nplication of vectors are introduced.\nAddition\nTo obtain the sum or resultant of two vectors a and b,\nmove b so that initial point of b coincides with the ter-\nminal point of a. Then the sum of a and b, written as\na + b, is de\ufb01ned by the vector (arrow) from the initial\npoint of a to the terminal point b. Similarly placing\nthe tail of a with the tip of b, the resultant b + a is\nobtained. Thus the vector addition follows the par-\nallelogram law of addition, i.e., the resultant of a\nparallelogram with a and b as adjacent sides is given\nby the diagonal of the parallelogram. Vector addi-\ntion is commutative a + b = b + a and is associative\na + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.\n\u2013a\nb\n+ \u2013\n\u2013a b\n+ \u2013\n\u2013b a\n+\u2013\na\na\nb\nb\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013b a\n+\u2013\nb\u2013\na\u2013\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 1.3\nDifference\na \u2212b = a + (\u2212b)\nRectangular unit vectors:\n\u2013b\nb\na\na b\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013 \u2013\nFig. 1.4\nConsider a right handed rectangular coordinate sys-\ntem.

Suppose a = a1i + a2j +\na3k and b = b1i + b2j + b3k.

Note that dot product is a scalar\nquantity. It is positive, zero or negative depending on\nwhether \u03b8 is acute angle, right angle or obtuse angle.\nThus for non-zero vectors.\na \u00b7 b = 0 implies that \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2\ni.e., a and b are perpendicular or orthogonal to each\nother.

Similarly a \u00b7 b can be interpreted as the product\nof length of b with the projection of a on b. ie. dot\nproduct is length of either multiplied by projection\nof the other upon it.

This led to the in-\ntroduction of complex numbers. A complex number\ndenoted by z is de\ufb01ned as\nz = x + iy\nwhere x and y are real, while i =\n\u221a\n\u22121 is known as\nthe imaginary unit. Here x is known as the real part\nof z and y as the imaginary part of z and are denoted\nas\nx = Real part of z = Re(z)\ny = Imaginary part of z = Im(z).\nFor y = 0, real numbers form a subset of the com-\nplex numbers. When x = 0, the complex number is\nknown purely imaginary complex number z. It can\nbe represented as an ordered pair (x, y) and thus as a\npoint in a plane known as complex plane or Argand\u2217\ndiagram. Here the x-axis is called as real axis, while\nthe y-axis as imaginary axis.\nEquality:\nTwo complex numbers z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 +\niy2 are said to be equal if x1 = x2 and y1 = y2. Thus\nz1 = z2 when their corresponding real parts are equal\nand corresponding imaginary parts are also equal.\nOtherwise they are said to be not equal i.e., z1  = z2.\nNote:\nHowever inequalities between complex\nnumbers such as z1 > z2 or z1 \u2264z2 has no mean-\ning since the \ufb01eld of complex numbers can not be\nordered. Thus 2 + 3i > 3 + 7i or \u22126 \u22122i < 0 have\nno meaning.\nZero\nA complex number z is zero if both the real and\nimaginary parts x and y are zero.\nConjugate complex numbers or complex conjugate\nnumber of z denoted by z is de\ufb01ned as\nz = x \u2212iy\ni.e., z and z differ only in the sign of the imaginary\npart.\nTrigonometric form of a Complex Number\nSinceevery complexnumberisrepresentedas apoint\nin the complex plane and vice versa, the complex\n* Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822), French mathematician.\nnumber z = x + iy is geometrically represented by\nthe position vector OP where O is the origin and\nP is the point (x, y). Let (r, \u03b8) denote the polar co-\nordinates of P ; with origin treated as the pole and\npositive x-axis as the polar axis. Then\nx = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8\nSo z = x + iy = r cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8\nz = r(cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8) = r cis \u03b8\nThis expression is known as the trigonometric form\nor polar form.

Here \u03b8 is the argument (or\namplitude or phase) of z, denoted as\n\u03b8 = arg z = tan\u22121 y\nx . The polar form is also known\nas modulus-amplitude form.\nThus absolute value of z is\n|z| =\n \nx2 + y2.\nAmplitude, \u03b8, the directed angle from positive x-axis\nis positive in the counterclockwise direction and is\nreckoned negative in the clockwise (opposite direc-\ntion). \u03b8 is measured in radians. It is not unique, but\nmultivalued and is determined up to 2\u03c0k, for any\ninteger k.\nPrincipal value\nPrincipal value of argument z is denoted by Arg z is\nthe value of \u03b8 which lies in the interval \u2212\u03c0 < \u03b8 \u2264\u03c0.\nNote:\nAlthough z and z have the same moduli.\nTheir arguments are equal in magnitude but differ\nin sign.\nThat is\narg z = \u2212arg z\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n1.21\nwhile |z| =\n \nx2 + y2 = |z|\nFor any z,\n1. |z| \u2265|Re(z)| \u2265Re(z)\n2. |z| \u2265|Im(z)| \u2265Im(z).\nComplex Algebra\nAddition\nSum of two complex numbers\nz1 + z2 = (x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) =\n= (x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2)\nobtained by adding the corresponding real and imag-\ninary parts.\ny\nz1\nz2\nz\nz\n1\n2\n+\nx\nO\nFig. 1.24\nSo sum of two complex numbers z1 + z2 is given\nby the diagonal of the parallelogram with z1 and z2\nas adjacent sides (Fig. 1.24).\nDifference\nSubtraction z1 \u2212z2 is de\ufb01ned\nz1 \u2212z2 = (x1 \u2212y1) + i(y1 \u2212y2)\nSo\n|z1 \u2212z2| =\n \n(x1 \u2212x2)2 + (y1 \u2212y2)2\nThus the modulus of the difference between two\nnumbers z1 and z2 equals to the distance between z1\nand z2 [in the complex plane (see Fig. 1.25)].\nz\nz\n1\n2\n\u2013\nz1\nz2\ny\nO\nFig. 1.25\nMultiplication\nz1 \u00b7 z2 = (x1 + iy1)(x2 + iy2) = (x1x2 \u2212y1y2)\n+ i(x1y2 + x2y1)\nSince i2 = \u22121, (i3 = \u2212i, i4 = 1 etc. and in general\ni4k = 1, i4k+1 = i, i4k+2 = \u22121, i4k+3 = \u2212i).\nIn the polar form\nSuppose z1 = r1 cis \u03b81, z2 = r2cis\u03b82 then\nz1z2 = (r1 cis \u03b81)(r2 cis \u03b82)\n= r1r2[cos \u03b81 + i sin \u03b81][cos \u03b82 + i sin \u03b82]\n= r1r2[(cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 \u2212sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82)+\n+i(sin \u03b81 \u00b7 cos \u03b82 + cos \u03b81 \u00b7 sin \u03b82)]\nThus z = rei\u03b8 = z1z2\nz1z2 = r1r2[cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82) + i sin(\u03b8i + \u03b82)]\nThus the modulus of the product is the product\nof the moduli i.e., r = |z| = r1r2 = |z1||z2| and the\nargument of the product is the sum of the arguments,\ni.e., \u03b8 = \u03b81 + \u03b82. or arg(z1z2) = arg z1 + arg z2.\nDivision\nz1\nz2 is de\ufb01ned as the inverse operation of multiplica-\ntion.

The mathematical\nstudy of change, motion, growth or decay is calculus.\nOne of the most important ideas of differential calcu-\nlus is derivative which measures the rate of change\nof a given function. Concept of derivative is very\nuseful in engineering, science, economics, medicine\nand computer science. In this chapter we study the\n300-year old Mitchel Rolle\u2019s theorem, Lagrange\u2019s\nmean value theorem which connects the average rate\nof change of a function over an interval with the in-\nstantaneous rate of change of the function at a point\nwithin that interval, generalized mean value theorem\n(Taylor\u2019s theorem) which enables to express any dif-\nferentiable function in power series, namely Taylor\u2019s\nand Maclaurin\u2019s series. We also consider the prob-\nlem of \ufb01nding curvature, evolutes and envelope of a\ncurve.\nSuppose a function y = f (x) = x4 + e2x + 3 sin 4x\nis differentiated w.r.t. x, then we get the \ufb01rst order\nderivative of y denoted by y = f  = 4x3 + 2e2x +\n12 cos 4x which is itself a function of x. Differen-\ntiating y again w.r.t. x, we get the second order\nderivative, denoted as y  = f   = 12x2 + 4e2x \u2212\n48 sin 4x, which is again a function of x. So by differ-\nentiating a second order derivative, we get the third\norder derivative and so on. Thus by differentiating a\nfunction y = f (x), n times successively, we get the\nnth order derivative of y or simply nth derivative of\ny denoted by y(n)(x), f (n)(x), Dny, dny\ndxn or yn(x).\nNote:\nThe order of the derivative is taken in paren-\ntheses so as to avoid confusion with the exponent of\na power. The order of the derivative is also denoted\nsometimes by Roman numerals for example 4th, 5th,\n6th order derivatives are denoted by yiv, yv, yvi etc.\n2.1\nDERIVATION OF nth DERIVATIVE OF\nSOME ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS\nPower Function\nConsider y = (ax + b)m, where m is any real num-\nber.

ncnu0vn.\nProof by mathematical induction:\nBy direct differentiation, we have\nd\ndx (uv) = (uv)1 = du\ndx v + u dv\ndx = u1v0 + u0v1\nd2\ndx2 (uv) = (uv)2 = u2v0 + u1v1 + u1v1 + u0v2\n= u2v0 + 2u1v1 + u0v2.\nHere the subscripts indicate the orders of deriva-\ntive and zero indices in the end terms indicate the\nfunctions themselves (i.e., derivatives of zero order).\nThus\n(uv)3 = u3v0 + u2v1 + 2u2v1 + 2u1v2 + u1v2 + u0v3\n= u3v0 + 3u2v1 + 3u1v2 + u0v3.\nSimilarly,\n(uv)4 = u4v0 + 4u3v1 + 6u2v2 + 4u1v3 + u0v4.\nAssume that the Leibnitz\u2019s theorem is valid for k.\nThen\n(uv)k = ukv0 + kc1uk\u22121v1 + kc2uk\u22122v2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n+kcr\u22121uk\u2212r+1vr\u22121 + kcr uk\u2212rvr + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n+kcku0vk.\nDifferentiating the above both sides\n(uv)k+1 = uk+1v0 + (ukv1 + kc1uk \u00b7 v1)\n+(kc1uk\u22121v2 + kc2uk\u22121v2)\n+kc2uk\u22122v3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + kcr\u22121uk\u2212r+2vr\u22121\n+(kcr\u22121uk\u2212r+1vr + kcr uk\u2212r+1vr)\n+kcruk\u2212rvr+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + kcku1vk + kcku0vk+1.\nWe know that\nkcr\u22121 + kcr = (k + 1) cr,\nkck = (k + 1)c(k+1) = 1\n1 + kc1 = 1 + k = (k + 1)c1.\n\n2.8\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nTherefore\n(uv)k+1 = uk+1v0 + (k + 1)c1ukv1 + (k + 1)c2uk\u22121v2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (k + 1)cruk\u2212r+1vr\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (k + 1)c(k + 1)u0vk+1\ni.e., theorem is valid for k + 1 also.\nHence by mathematical induction the result is\nvalid for any n.\nNote:\nThe Leibnitz\u2019s rule (or formula) is obtained\nby expanding (u + v)n by the binomial theorem\nand in the expansion obtained the exponents of the\npowers of u and v are replaced by (subscripts) indices\nthat are the orders of the derivatives.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nFind the nth

Since f is continuous in [a, b], it is bounded and\nattains its maximum M and minimum m say at\ntwo numbers c and d lying in between a and b\nsuch that\nf (c) = M and f (d) = m.\nCase a:\nIf M = m, then f is a constant function so\nthat f  is zero for all x in (a, b).\nCase b:\nIf M  = m, then M = f (c) \u2265f (c + h) for\nvalues of h both positive and negative.

Here\nf  (x) = ln x + (x \u22122) \u00b7 1\nx\nf  (x) = x ln x + x \u22122\nx\nThus f  (c) = c ln c+c\u22122\nc\n= 0\nor c is the root (solution) of the equation\nx ln x \u22122 + x = 0.\nExample 4:\nShow that the equation f   (x) = 0 has\nat least one real root between a and b if f, f  , f   \nare continuous in a \u2264x \u2264b and the curve y = f (x)\ncrosses the x-axis at least at 3 distinct points between\na and b inclusive.\nSolution:\nLet c, d, e be the three points where\ny = f (x) crosses the x-axis. Then f (c) = f (d) =\nf (e) = 0. Assume a < c < d < e < b. The func-\ntion f satis\ufb01es Rolle\u2019s theorem in the two intervals\n(c, d) and (d, e), since f and f  are continuous and\nf (c) = f (d) = f (e) = 0. Therefore there exists at\nleast one point in each interval (c, d) and (d, e) such\nthat derivative is zero.\nLet c1 \u2208(c, d) such that f  (c1) = 0 and c2 \u2208(d, e)\nsuch that f  (c2) = 0. Now the function f  satis\ufb01es\nRolle\u2019s theorem because f  , f   are continuous and\nf  (c1) = f  (c2) = 0. Therefore by Rolle\u2019s theorem\nthere exists a number c3 in between c1 and c2 such\nthat f   (c3) = 0. Thus at least one root c3 of the equa-\ntion f   (x) = 0 lies in the interval (a, b).\nExample 5:\nWithout solving, show that the equa-\ntion x4 + 2x3 \u22122 = 0 has one and only one real root\nbetween 0 and 1.\nSolution:\nLet f (x) = x4 + 2x3 \u22122 which is con-\ntinuous and differentiable in (0, 1). f  (x) = 4x3 +\n6x2 = x2(4x + 6) = 0 only when x = 0 or x = \u22126\n4\nboth of which do not lie in between 0 and 1. Thus\nf  (x)  = 0 for any x \u2208(0, 1). By Rolle\u2019s theorem,\nthere do not exist a and b such that f (a) = 0 and\nf (b) = 0 i.e., the equation f (x) = 0 can not have\ntwo real roots. Further f (0) = \u22122 and f (1) = 1 are\nof opposite signs and f  (x) > 0 for every x in (0, 1).\nTherefore f (x) crosses the x-axis exactly once.

For a particular given value of\n\u03b1, the equation\nf (x, y, \u03b1) = 0\n(1)\nrepresents a plane curve in the xy-plane. Thus the\none-parameter family of curves is the totality of all\nthe curves having one common property obtained\nfrom (1) by assigning different values to \u03b1. The\nvariable \u03b1 is known as the parameter and the equa-\ntion (1) f (x, y, \u03b1) = 0 represents a one-parameter\nfamily (or system or group) of curves.\nExample:\ny = mx + 6 represents a family of\nstraight lines all passing through the point (0, 6) but\nhaving different slopes assigned by the parameter m.\nExample:\n(x \u2212a)2 + y2 = 4 represents a family\nof circles all with radius 2 but with different\ncenters lying on x-axis for different values of the\nparameter a.\nIn a similar way, a two-parameter family of curves\nis represented by the equation f (x, y, \u03b1, \u03b2) = 0\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are the two parameters.\nExample:\nFamily of concentric and coaxial el-\nlipsesgivenby x2\na2 + y2\nb2 =1witha, b astheparameters.\nNote:\nIf the two parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 are connected by\na relation, then the two-parameter family reduces to\na one-parameter family of curves.\nEnvelope E of a given family of curves c is a curve\nwhich touches every member of the family of curves\nc and at each point of the envelope E is touched by\nsome member of the family of curves c.\nExample:\nThe x-axis y = 0 is the envelope of the\nfamily of semicubical parabolas y2 \u2212(x + b)3 = 0\nwith b as the parameter (see Fig. 2.17).\nFig. 2.17\nExample:\nThe two lines x = a and x = \u2212a are the\ntwo envelopes to the family of circles\nx2 + (y \u2212b)2 = a2\nwith centres on y-axis and of given radius a. Here b\nis the parameter (see Fig. 2.18).\nFig. 2.18\nExample:\nThe family of circles x2+(y\u2212b)2=b2\nwith centres lying on y-axis, have no envelope (refer\nFig. 2.19).\nThus a family of curves may have no envelope or\nunique envelope or several envelopes.\nEnvelope may be de\ufb01ned in a rigorous way as the\nlocus of the limiting position of point of intersection\nof one member of the family with a neighbouring\nmember as the later tends to the former.\n\n2.66\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nFig. 2.19\nMethod of Obtaining Envelope\nI. Envelope is obtained generally by eliminating\nthe parameter \u03b1 between the equation of the\ngiven family curves\nf (x, y, \u03b1) = 0\n(1)\nand\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03b1 = f\u03b1(x, y, \u03b1) = 0\n(2)\nwhere \u2202f\n\u2202\u03b1 is the partial derivative of f w.r.t. \u03b1.\nII. In case \u03b1 can not be eliminated between (1) and\n(2) then solve (1) and (2) for x and y in terms of\n\u03b1. Then the envelope is given in the parametric\nform by the equations\nx = x(\u03b1)\nand\ny = y(\u03b1)\nIII. If the equation (1) is a quadratic in the parameter\n\u03b1 or quadratic in some parameter \u03bb which is\na function of \u03b1, then the envelope is given by\ndiscriminant equated to zero.\nSuppose f (x, y, \u03b1) = 0 is rewritten as a\nquadratic equation\nA\u03bb2 + B\u03bb + C = 0\n(3)\nwhere A, B, C are functions of x, y while \u03bb is\neither \u03b1 or function of \u03b1. Differentiating (3)\nw.r.t. \u03bb,\n2A\u03bb + B = 0\nor\n\u03bb = \u2212B\n2A\n(4)\nEliminating \u03bb from (3) by using (4) we get the\nequation of the required envelope as\nA\n \n\u2212B\n2A\n 2\n+ B\n \n\u2212B\n2A\n \n+ C = 0\ni.e.,\nB2 \u22124AC = discriminant = 0\nIV. Envelope of the family of normals to a given\ncurve C is the evolute of the curve C.\nV. For a given two parameter family of curves\nf (x, y, \u03b1, \u03b2) = 0\n(5)\nwith a given relation g(\u03b1, \u03b2) = 0 between the\nparameters \u03b1, \u03b2, (5) can be reduced to a one\nparameter family by elimination of one of the\nparameters say \u03b2 in terms of \u03b1 by using the\ngiven relation g(\u03b1, \u03b2).

In this\nchapter we study the limit, continuity, partial deriva-\ntive of such functions, Euler\u2019s theorem, Jacobians\nwhich determine the functional dependence and de-\ntermination of errors and approximations of calcula-\ntions.\n3.1\nFUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL\nVARIABLES: LIMIT AND CONTINUITY\nThe area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab. It depends on two vari-\nables a and b; The total surface area of a rectangular\nparallelopiped is 2(xy + yz + zx) and it depends on\n3 variables x, y, z; The velocity u of a \ufb02uid particle\nmoving in space depends on 4 variables x, y, z, t.\nIn transportation problem in operations research the\ncost function to be minimized is a function of several\n(m \u00b7 n: running into hundreds) variables (where m is\nthe number of origins and n is the number of desti-\nnations). Thus functions of several variables plays a\nvital role in advanced Mathematics.\nIf u = f (x, y, z, t) then x, y, z, t are known as the\nindependent variables or arguments and u is known\nas the \u2018dependent variable\u2019 or \u2018value\u2019 of the function.\nIn this section, we restrict to functions of two and\nthree variables, although the analysis can easily be\nextended to several variables.\nFunction of Two Variables\nIf for every x and y a unique value f (x, y) is as-\nsociated, then f is said to be a function of the two\nindependent variables x and y and is denoted by\nz = f (x, y)\n(1)\nGeometrically, in three dimensional xyz-coordi-\nnate space (1) represents a surface. The values of x\nand y for which the function is de\ufb01ned is known as\nthe domain of de\ufb01nition of the function:\nExample:\nz =\n\u0001\na2 \u2212x2 \u2212y2\ndomain :\nx2 + y2 \u2264a2\nFunction not de\ufb01ned when x2 + y2 > a2.\nExample:\nz = xy + yx\ndomain :\nx > 0\nand\ny > 0\n\u03b4-neighbourhood of a point (a, b) in the xy-plane\nis a square with centre at (a, b) bounded by the four\nlines x = a \u2212\u03b4, x = a + \u03b4, y = b \u2212\u03b4, y = b + \u03b4 i.e.,\na \u2212\u03b4 \u2264x \u2264a + \u03b4\nb \u2212\u03b4 \u2264x \u2264b + \u03b4.\n3.1\n\n3.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nNote:\nNeighbourhood of a point (a, b) may also be\nde\ufb01ned as a circular disk with centre at (a, b) and of\nradius \u03b4 given by\n(x \u2212a)2 + (y \u2212b)2 < \u03b42\nconcept of limit is paramount in de\ufb01ning continuity\nand differentiability of a function. Note that all the\nthree concepts of limit, continuity and differentiabil-\nity are point concepts i.e., de\ufb01ned at a point.\nLimit:\nA function f (x, y) is said to have a limit L\nas the point (x, y) approaches (a, b) and is denoted as\nlim\n(x,y)\u2192(a,b) f (x, y) = L\nif the value of f (x, y) can be made as close (as we\nplease) to the given \ufb01nite number L for all those\n(x, y) in an appropriately chosen \u03b4-neighbourhood\nof (a, b), i.e., for a given  > 0 we can \ufb01nd a \u03b4 such\nthat\n|f (x, y) \u2212L| <  \nfor all (x, y) in the \u03b4-neighbourhood\n|x \u2212a| < \u03b4\nand\n|y \u2212b| < \u03b4\n(or alternatively when (x \u2212a)2 + (y \u2212b)2 < \u03b42).\nImportant Note:\nThe limit of a function f (x, y)\nof two variables is said to exist only when the same\nvalue is obtained for the limit along any path in the\nxy-plane from (x, y) to (a, b) say along x \u2192a and\ny \u2192b or along y \u2192b and x \u2192a, etc.\nLimit may or may not exist. If it exists limit must\nbe unique.\nMethod of Obtaining Limit\nStep I: Evaluate lim f (x, y) along path I: x \u2192a\nand x \u2192b\nStep II: Evaluate lim f (x, y) along path II: y \u2192b\nand x \u2192a\nIf the limit values along path I and II are\nsame, the limit exist. Otherwise not.\nStep III: If a = 0, b = 0, evaluate limit along say\npath y = mx or y = mxn also.\nResults:\nIf\nlim\n(x,y)\u2192(a,b)f (x, y) = L and\nlim\n(x,y)\u2192(a,b)\ng(x, y) = M.

An important application\nof multivariable differential calculus is \ufb01nding the\nmaximum and minimum values of functions of sev-\neral variables and determining where they occur. In\nthe study of stability of the equilibrium states of\nmechanical and physical systems, determination of\nextrema is of greatest importance. Lagrange multi-\npliers method developed by Lagrange in 1755 is a\npowerful method for \ufb01nding extreme values of con-\nstrained functions in economics, in designing multi-\nstage rockets in engineering, in geometry etc.\n4.1\nTAYLOR\u2019S THEOREM FOR FUNCTION\nOF TWO VARIABLES\nFunctions of two or more variables often can be\nexpanded in power series which generalize the\nfamiliar one-dimensional expansion.

The value of the function f at an ex-\ntremum (maximum or minimum) point is known as\nthe extremum (maximum or minimum) value of the\nfunction f.\nGeometrically, z = f (x, y) represents a surface.\nThe maximum is a point on the surface (hill top) from\nwhich the surface descends (comes down) in every\ndirection towards the xy-plane (see Fig. 4.1). The\nminimum is the bottom of depression from which the\nsurface ascends (climbs up) in every direction (refer\nFig. 4.1). In either case, the tangent planes to the sur-\nface at a maximum or minimum point is horizontal\n(parallel to xy-plane) and perpendicular to z-axis.\n\n4.6\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nFig. 4.1\nZ\nX\nY\nZ\nSaddle point or minimax is a point where func-\ntion is neither maximum nor minimum.

Since the stationary values occur when\nfx = fy = fz = 0, so the total differential\ndf = fxdx + fydy + fzdz = 0\n(3)\nDifferential of the constraint (2) is\ndg = gxdx + gydy + gzdz = 0\n(4)\nMultiplying (4) by \u03bb and adding to (3), we get\n(fx + \u03bbgx)dx + (fy + \u03bbgy)dy\n+ (fz + \u03bbgz)dz = 0\n(5)\nSince x, y, z are independent variables (5) im-\nplies that\nfx + \u03bbgx = 0\n(6)\nfy + \u03bbgy = 0\n(7)\nfz + \u03bbgz = 0\n(8)\nSolving the four Equations (2), (6), (7), (8) for\nthe four unknowns x, y, z, \u03bb, we get the required\nstationary points of f (x, y, z) subject to the\n\nMAXIMA AND MINIMA\n4.11\nconstraint (2). Thus the method of Lagrange\u2019s\nmultipliers consists of:\nStep I. From the auxiliary equation\nF(x, y, z) = f (x, y, z) + \u03bb\u03c6(x, y, z)\n(9)\nStep II. Partially differentiate F in (9) w.r.t. x, y, z\nrespectively\nStep III. Solve the four equations\nFx = 0, Fy = 0, Fz = 0\nand the constraint (2) for the Lagrange multiplier\n\u03bb and stationary values x, y, z.\nAdvantages\n1. The stationary value f (x, y, z) can be determined\nfrom (2), (6), (7), (8) even without determining\nx, y, z explicitly.\n2. This method can be extended to a function of sev-\neral \u2018n\u2019 variables x1, x2, x3, . . . xn and subject to\nmany (more than one) \u2018m\u2019 constraints by forming\nthe auxiliary equation\nF(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = f (x1, x2, . . . , xn)\n+\nm\n\u0007\ni=1\n\u03bbi\u03c6i(x1, x2, . . . , xn).\nThe stationary values are obtained by solving the\nn + m equations consisting of n equations \u2202F\n\u2202xi =\n0, for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . n and the m constraint, \u03c6i =\n0 for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . m.\nDisadvantages\n1. Nature of the stationary points can not be deter-\nmined. Further investigation needed.\n2. Equations (6), (7), (8) are only necessary condi-\ntions but not suf\ufb01cient.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nFind the maximum value of xmynzp\nwhen x + y + z = a.\nSolution:\nThis is a constrained maximum problem\nwhere the function f (x, y, z) = xmynzp, subjected\nto the constraint x + y + z = a.

Real solution m = \u22121.\n\u03c62(m) = \u22123am (obtained by putting x = 1 and\ny = m in the next highest degree 2 term \u22123axy)\nc = \u2212(\u22123am)\n(3m2)\n= a\nm,\nAt m = \u22121, c = \u2212a\nThus,\ny = mx + c = \u2212x \u2212a\nor\ny + x + a = 0\nis the oblique asymptote.\nOrigin\nIf origin (0, 0) lies on the curve then there will be no\nconstant term in equation (1).\nTangents to the Curve at the Origin\nWhen the curve passes through origin, then the\ntangents to the curve at this origin are obtained by\nequating to zero the group (or collection) of the\nlowest degree terms in (1).\nExample:\ny2 = 4ax, lowest degree term 4ax\nequated to zero gives x = 0 (y-axis) as tangent to\ncurve at origin.\nExample:\nx3 + y3 = 3axy, lowest degree term\n3axy equated to zero gives xy = 0 or x = 0 and\ny = 0 are the two tangents to the curve at origin.\nExample:\na2y2 = a2x2 \u2212x4, lowest degree term\n(y2 \u2212x2) equating to zero gives y = \u00b1x as the two\ntangents at origin.\nIntercepts\na. The x-intercept (i.e., the point where the curve\nmeets the x-axis) is obtained by putting y = 0 in\n(1) and solving for x. Similarly y-intercept (where\ncurve crosses y-axis) is obtained by putting x = 0\nin (1) and solving for y.\nb. Points of intersection: when curve is symmetric\nabout the line y = \u00b1x, the points of intersection\nare obtained by putting y = \u00b1x in Equation (1).\nc. Tangents to the curve at other points (h, k) can\nbe obtained by shifting the origin to these points\n(h, k) by the substitution x = X + h, y = Y + k\nand calculating the tangents at origin in the new\nXY-plane.\nNote:\nAt point where dy\ndx = 0, the tangent is parallel\nto x-axis i.e., horizontal. At point where dy\ndx = \u221e, the\ntangent is vertical i.e., parallel to y-axis.\nSign of First Derivative dy\ndx\nIn an interval a \u2264x \u2264b if\na.\ndy\ndx > 0 then curve is increasing in [a, b]\nb.\ndy\ndx < 0 then curve is decreasing in [a, b]\nc.

Curve is symmetric about x-axis since y2 is\npresent in the equation.\n2. Origin lies on the curve.\n3. Tangents at origin: Equating to zero the lowest\ndegree terms i.e., y2 = 0. Thus x-axis is a coin-\ncidental tangent to the curve at the origin. Hence\norigin is a cusp.\n4. Intercepts: only intercept point is x = 0, y = 0.\ni.e., origin is the only point where curve meets the\ncoordinate axes.\n\n5.10\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\n5. Asymptotes: Asymptotes parallel to y-axis are\ngiven by equating to zero, the coef\ufb01cient of the\nhighest degree terms in y i.e., a \u2212x = 0. Thus\nx = a is the asymptote. For a > 0 the asymptote\nx = a is parallel to y-axis and lies to the right\n(y > 0).\nSince coef\ufb01cient of x3 is constant, no asymp-\ntotes parallel to x-axis.\n6.

Curve is symmetric about y-axis.\n2. Curve does not pass through origin.\n3. y-intercept: curve meets y-axis at (0, 2a).\nx-intercept: curve does not cross x-axis.\n4. Tangent at (0, 2a) : dy\ndx =\n\u221216a3x\n(x2+4a2)2\nSo dy\ndx = 0 when x = 0. (then y = 2a).\nThus at (0, 2a), the tangent is parallel to\nx-axis i.e., the horizontal line y = 2a is tangent\nat (0, 2a).\n5. Region: y is always positive for any value of x\n(because of the presence of x2 term). Thus curve\nlies above the x-axis (y > 0). Also solving the\nequation x = 2a\n\u0001\n2a\u2212y\ny\n\u0002 1\n2 .\nx is imaginary when y < 0 or y > 2a.\nCurve does not exist below the x-axis (i.e., y <\n0) and above the horizontal line y = 2a (i.e., y >\n2a). So region is 0 < y < 2a, \u2212\u221e< x < \u221e.\n6. Asymptotes: Asymptote parallel to x-axis is ob-\ntained by equating the coef\ufb01cient of highest\npower of x i.e., coef\ufb01cient of x2 namely y to zero.\nThus y = 0 (x-axis) is the asymptote.\nNo asymptote parallel to y-axis because the co-\nef\ufb01cient of y namely x2 + 4a2 has no real factors.\n7.

Curve is symmetric about both x-axis and y-axis\nsince it contains even powers of x and y.\n2. Origin lies on the curve.\n3. Tangents at origin are obtained by equating the\nlowest degree term (y2 \u2212x2)a2 to zero. Thus y =\n\u00b1x are the two tangents to the curve at origin.\nHence origin is a node because there two real\ndistinct tangents.\n4. Asymptotes: no asymptotes parallel to x-axis\nbecause the coef\ufb01cient of x4 is constant. No\nasymptotes parallel to y-axis because the coef-\n\ufb01cient of y2 has no real factors.\n5. Intercepts: x-intercept is (0, 0).\ny-intercept is x2(a2 \u2212x2) = 0 or x = 0 or x \u00b1 a.\nFig. 5.23\nThus curve meets the x-axis at A(\u2212a, 0) and\nB(a, 0). To \ufb01nd the tangents at A and B, shift the\norigin to (\u00b1a, 0). So put X = x + a, Y = y + 0 in\nthe equation of the curve.\nThen\nY 2[a2 + (X + a)2] = (X + a)2[a2 \u2212(X \u00b1 a)2]\nor\nY 2[2a2 + 2aX + X2] = (X + a2)2[\u22122aX \u2212X2]\nEquating to zero the lowest degree terms the tangent\nat the next origin i.e., \u22122aX3 = 0 i.e., new y-axis.\nThus X = x \u00b1 a = 0 or x = \u00b1a are the tangents to\nthe curve at B and A.\n6.

Then for \u2212a < x < x2 and 0 < x < x1, y > 0\ncurve is increasing in these two intervals.\nFor x2 < x < 0 and x1 < x < a, y < 0 curve is\ndecreasing in these two intervals. Similarly for y < 0\ntake y with \u2212ve sign. Then for \u2212a < x < x2 and\n0 < x < x1, y < 0, curve decreasing.\nFor x2 < x < 0 and x1 < x < a, y > 0, curve\nincreasing. M1, M2, m1, m2 are the extrema at\nx1, x2 (Fig. 5.23).\nExample 5:\ny = x + 1\nx\nSolution:\n1. Curve is symmetric about the origin since\nf (\u2212x, \u2212y) = f (x, y) (but is not symmetric\nabout both x- and y-axis because of the odd pow-\ners of x and y).\n2. Origin does not lie on the curve.\n3. No intercepts: Rewriting the equation we get\nx2 \u2212xy + 1 = 0. This has no solutions when\nx = 0 (1 = 0) and y = 0, (x2 + 1 = 0).\n\n5.12\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\n4. Region: y is de\ufb01ned for any value of x except\nx = 0 where it is discontinous. Thus Region is\n{\u2212\u221e< x < \u221e} \u2212{0} i.e., R \u2212{0}.\n5. Asymptotes: As x \u21920, y \u2192\u00b1\u221eso y-axis is an\nasymptote.

No multiple points: f (x, y) = x2 \u2212xy + 1 = 0.\nfx(x, y) = 2x \u2212y = 0, fy(x, y) = \u2212x = 0 has\nno solution.\n7.

For 0 < x < 1, y < 0, curve is decreasing.\nFor 1 < x < \u221e, y > 0, curve is increasing.\nSimilarly (also by symmetry about origin).\nFor \u2212\u221e<x <\u22121, y >0, curve is increasing.\n\u22121 < x < 0, y < 0, curve is decreasing.\n8. No in\ufb02ection points: since y   = 0.\nExample 6:\ny2(x \u2212a) = x2(x + a), a > 0\nSolution:\n1. Curve is symmetric about x-axis only.\n2. Curve passes through origin.\n3. Tangents at origin: Equating to zero group of\nterms with lowest degree i.e., a(x2 + y2) = 0.\nThe two tangents y = \u00b1ix are imaginary.\n4. Therefore origin is an isolated point.\n5. Intercepts: y-intercept: x = 0 then y = 0 so\norigin (0, 0) is the y-intercept point.\nx-intercept: y = 0 then x = 0 or x = \u2212a. Thus\nA(\u2212a, 0) is x-intercept.\nThe tangent at A is x = a which is obtained by\nputting x = X \u2212a and Y = y = 0 in the equa-\ntion resulting in y2X = (X + a)2(X + 2a) and\nequating to zero the lowest term i.e., X = 0 or\nx + a = 0 i.e., x = \u2212a (Fig. 5.25).\nFig. 5.25\n6.

Curve is symmetric about the line \u03b8 = \u03c0\n4 since\nf (r, \u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b8) = r2 \u2212a2 sin 2\n\u0001\u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b8\n\u0002\n= r2 \u2212a2 sin (\u03c0 \u22122\u03b8)\n= r2 \u2212a2 sin 2\u03b8 = f (r, \u03b8)\n2. Pole: Curve passes through the pole (ori-\ngin 0) since at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 , the value of\nr2 = a2 sin 2 \u00b7 0 = 0.Thusthetwotangentstothe\ncurve at the pole are given by \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2\n(i.e., x and y-axis).

Region:\na. Curve lies completely within a circle of radius\n\u2018a\u2019 since the maximum value of sin 2 \u03b8 is 1.\nb. Imaginary: sin \u03b8 curve is negative when \u03b8 is\nbetween \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, then sin 2\u03b8 is negative be-\ntween \u03c0\n2 to \u03c0.

Symmetry: Curve is symmetric about the line\n\u03b8= \u03c0\n2 passingthroughthepole0andperpendicular\nto the initial line, since\nr(\u03c0 \u2212\u03b8) = a sin(3(\u03c0 \u2212\u03b8))\n= a sin 3\u03b8 = r(\u03b8)\n2. Pole: Curve passes through the pole 0 when r =\na sin 3\u03b8 = 0 i.e., when 3\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, 4\u03c0,\n5\u03c0.Thusfor\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0\n3 , 2\u03c0\n3 ,\u03c0, 4\u03c0\n3 , 5\u03c0\n3 ,curvepasses\nthrough the pole. The tangents to the curve at the\npole are given by the lines \u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = \u03c0\n3 , \u03b8 = 2\u03c0\n3 ,\n\u03b8 = \u03c0, \u03b8 = 4\u03c0\n3 and \u03b8 = 5\u03c0\n3 . Pole is a node since\n\u03b8 = \u03c0\n3 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0\n3 are two real distinct tangents\nat 0.\n3. Asymptote: No asymptote since r is always \ufb01nite\nfor any \u03b8. In fact maximum value of r is a since\nmaximum value of sin 3\u03b8 is 1. Thus the entire\ncurve lies within the region of the circle r = a.\n4. Intersection: Curve meets the line \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 at\nr = a sin 3( \u03c0\n2 ) = \u2212a.\n5. Variation of r: Variation of r as \u03b8 varies from 0\nto \u03c0\n3 .\n\u03b8:\n0\n\u03c0\n12\n\u03c0\n6\n\u03c0\n4\n\u03c0\n3\n3\u03b8:\n0\n\u03c0\n4\n\u03c0\n2\n3\u03c0\n4\n\u03c0\nr:\na\n\u00b77a\na\n\u00b77a\n0\n6. Loops: As \u03b8 varies from 0 to \u03c0\n3 , r varies from 0\nto a to 0. So the curve traverses the loop OAO\nin the \ufb01rst quadrant. This loop OAO is re\ufb02ected\nas the second loop OBO in the second quadrant\nbecause curve is symmetric about the line \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 .\nThus the second loop OBO is obtained as \u03b8 varies\nfrom 2\u03c0/3 to \u03c0.\n7.

Symmetry: Curve is symmetric about the\ninitial line since r(\u2212\u03b8) = 1 + 2 cos (\u2212\u03b8) =\n1 + 2 cos \u03b8 = r(\u03b8).\n2. Pole: Curve passes through the pole when\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0\n3 and \u03b8 = 4\u03c0\n3 because r = 1 + 2 cos 2\u03c0\n3\n= 1 \u22121 = 0 and r = 1 + 2 cos 4\u03c0\n3 = 1 \u22121 = 0.\n3.

Appli-\ncation of integral calculus includes \ufb01nding areas of\nirregular plane regions, length of curves, volume,\nsurface area of solid of revolution, mass, moment of\ninertia, centre of gravity. Successive application of a\nreduction formula, which connects an integral with\nanother integral of lower order, enables to evaluate\nthe given integral. Sine-integral function (useful in\noptics), gamma, beta, functions are some important\nimproper integrals.\n6.1\nREDUCTION FORMULAE\nReduction formulae reduces a given integral to a\nknown integration form by the repeated application\nof integration by parts.

If at least one\nof these conditions is violated, then the integral is\nknown as an improper integral (or singular or gener-\nalized or in\ufb01nite integral). More generally improper\nintegrals are classi\ufb01ed into three kinds.\nImproper Integral\nImproper integral of the \ufb01rst kind. It is a de\ufb01nite\nintegral in which one or both limits of integration\nare in\ufb01nite ie. the interval of integration is not \ufb01nite.\nThese are de\ufb01ned by the following relations.\n(a)\n \u221e\na\nf (x)dx = lim\nb\u2192\u221e\n b\na f (x)dx\n(2)\nIt is said to have a singularity at the upper limit\n(b)\n b\n\u2212\u221e\nf (x)dx =\nlim\na\u2192\u2212\u221e\n b\na\nf (x)dx\n(3)\n(c)\n \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf (x)dx =\nlim\nb \u2192\u221e\na \u2192\u2212\u221e\n b\na\nf (x)dx\n(4)\nor\n \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf (x)dx =\nlim\na\u2192\u2212\u221e\n 0\na\nf (x)dx + lim\nb\u2192\u221e\n b\n0\nf (x)dx\n(4\u2217)\nIf both the limits exist, we can write\n \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf (x)dx = lim\nr\u2192\u221e\n r\n\u2212r\nf (x)dx\n(4\u2217\u2217)\nThe improper integral is said to converge (or exist)\nwhen the limits in RHS of (2), (3), (4) or (4\u2217) or (4\u2217\u2217)\nexists (and are \ufb01nite). Otherwise it is said to diverge\n(when either of the limits fail to exist). The limit in\nthe RHS of (4\u2217\u2217) is known as the Cauchy\u2019s principal\nvalue of the improper integral.\nGeometrically for f (x) \u22650, the improper integral\n \u221e\na f (x)dx denotes the area of an unbounded (in\ufb01-\nnite region) lying between the curve y = f (x), the\nordinate x = a and axis of abscissa, i.e. x-axis.\nExample 1:\nConsider the improper integral\n \u221e\n0\ndx\n1+x2 .

General\nchange of variables involves evaluation of multiple\nintegrals by substitution. The aim of substitution is to\nreplace complicated integrals by one that are easier\nto evaluate. Change of variables simpli\ufb01es the inte-\ngrand, the limits of integration or both. Evaluation of\ntriple integral is simpli\ufb01ed by the use of cylindrical\nor spherical coordinates in problems of physics, en-\ngineering or geometry involving a cylinder, cone, or\nsphere. Dirichlet\u2019s integral is useful in the evaluation\nof certain double and triple integrals by expressing\nthem in terms of beta and gamma functions.\nMultiple integral is a natural extension of an (ordi-\nnary) de\ufb01nite integral to a function of two variables\n(double integral) or three variables (triple integral) or\nmore variables. Double and triple integrals are use-\nful in evaluating area, volume, mass, centroid and\nmoments of inertia of plane and solid regions.\n7.1\nDOUBLE INTEGRAL\nLet D be a closed\u2217and bounded\u2217\u2217domain in the\nXY-plane bounded by a simple closed curve c. Let\n\u2217Boundary included i.e., part of the region.\n\u2217\u2217Can be enclosed in a circle of \ufb01nite radius.\nf (x, y) be a given continuous function in D. Divide\nD into n parts and form the sum\nn\n \ni=1\nf (Pi) Si\nwhere f (Pi) is the value of f at an arbitrary point Pi\nof the subdomain whose area is  Si. Double integral\nof f (x, y) over the domain D is the limit of the above\nsum as n \u2192\u221eand is denoted by ID as\nID =\n  \nD\nf (P) dS =\n  \nD\nf (x, y) dx dy\n=\nlim\n Si\u21920\nn\n \ni=1\nf (Pi)  Si\n(1)\nHere D is known as the domain (region) of inte-\ngration.\nThe following properties of double integrals fol-\nlow from the de\ufb01nition (1).\nProperties of Double Integral\n1.\n  \nD\na f (x, y)dS = a\n  \nD\nf (x, y)dS, a = constant.\n2.\n  \nD\n[f (x, y) + g(x, y)]dS =\n  \nD\nf (x, y)dS. +\n+\n  \nD\ng(x, y)dS\n3.\n  \nD\nf (x, y)dS =\n  \nD1\nf (x, y)dS +\n  \nD2\nf (x, y)dS\nwhere D is the union of disjoint domains D1 and D2.\n7.1\n\n7.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nRegular Domain\nA domain D in XY-plane bounded by a curve c is\nsaid to be regular in the Y-direction, if straight lines\npassing through an interior point (a point which does\nnot lie on the boundary c) and parallel to Y-axis meets\nc in two points A and B (Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1\nIn such a case, the domain D is bounded by the two\ncurves c2 : GHE : y = y2(x) and c1 : EFG : y =\ny1(x) and the ordinates x = a and x = b such that\ny2(x) \u2264y1(x)\nand\na < b\nHere c is the sum of the two curves c1 and c2.\nInotherwords,\u201cA domainD issaidtobe \u201cregular\u201d\ndomain if it is regular in both X and Y directions\u201d.\nExamples of Regular Domain: Regions bounded\nby rectangle, triangle, circle, ellipses.\nExample of Non-regular Domain: Annulus region.\nEvaluation of a Double\nIntegral\nA double integral can be evaluated by successive sin-\ngle integrations i.e., as a two-fold iterated (repeated)\nintegral as follows (if D is regular in y-direction):\nID =\n b\nx=a\n  y2(x)\ny=y1(x)\nf (x, y)dy\n \ndx\n(2)\nwhere integration is performed \ufb01rst with respect to y\n(within the braces). With the substitution of the limits\ny1(x) and y2(x), the integrand becomes a function of\nx alone, which is then integrated with respect to x\nfrom a to b.\nIn a similar way, for a domain D (regular in x-\ndirection) which is bounded above by EHF x =\nx2(y) and bounded below by EGF: x = x1(y) and\nthe abscissa y = d and y = e (Fig. 7.2).\nFig. 7.2\nThe double integral is evaluated as\nID =\n e\ny=d\n  x2(y)\nx=x1(y)\nf (x, y)dx\n \ndy\n(3)\nIn this case the integration is \ufb01rst performed with\nrespect to x and then later with respect to y.\nNote 1:\nThe braces in (2) and (3) can be omitted,\nsince it is conventional to integrate \ufb01rst with respect\nto a variable whose differential appears \ufb01rst (for ex-\nample in (2) the order of integration is \ufb01rst y and\nlater x).\nNote 2:\nIf all the four limits are constants then the\norder of integration can be done in either way i.e.,\nintegration \ufb01rst with respect to x and later w.r.t. y\nor \ufb01rst w.r.t. y and later w.r.t. x, yielding the same\nresult, provided the limits are taken (for x and y)\naccordingly.\nNote 3:\nWhen D is regular (in both x and y di-\nrections), draw a rough sketch of D the domain of\nintegration to \ufb01x the limits of integration. Choose\n(or change) the order of integration (see Section 7.5)\nand use (2) or (3) whichever is easier for integ-\nration.\nNote 4:\nSuppose D is such that the lower\ncurve AFE : y = y1(x) consists of two different\ncurves\nAF : y1 = \u03c6(x),\na \u2264x \u2264e\nFE : y1 = \u03c8(x),\ne \u2264x \u2264b\n\nMULTIPLE INTEGRALS\n7.3\nwhile the upper curve is AGB : y = y2(x) (Fig.\n7.3).\nThen\nD=AFEBGA=AFGA+FEBG=\nD1 + D2, so that\nFig. 7.3\n  \nD\nf (x, y)dy dx =\n b\na\n y2(x)\ny1(x)\nf (x, y)dy dx\n=\n  \nD1\nf (x, y)dy dx\n+\n  \nD2\nf (x, y)dy dx\n=\n e\na\n y2(x)\n\u03c6(x)\nf (x, y)dy dx\n+\n b\ne\n y2(x)\n\u03c8(x)\nf (x, y)dy dx.\n(see Worked Out Example 4).\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nEvaluate the following double integrals as two-fold\niterated integral:\nExample 1:\nID =\n ln 8\n1\n ln y\n0\nex+ydx dy\nSolution:\nID =\n ln 8\n1\nex+y\n     \nln y\n0\ndy =\n ln 8\n1\n(ey+ln y \u2212ey)dy\nID =\n ln 8\n1\ney(y \u22121)dy =\n \nyey \u2212ey \u2212ey)\n   \nln 8\n1\n= 8 ln 8 \u221216 + e\nExample 2:\nID =\n  \nD(x2 + y2)dx dy where D is\nbounded by y = x and y2 = 4x.\nSolution:\nFig. 7.4\nID =\n 4\n0\n 2\u221ax\nx\n(x2 + y2)dy dx\n=\n 4\n0\nx2y + y3\n3\n     \n2\u221ax\nx\ndx\n=\n 4\n0\n \n2x\n5\n2 + 8\n3x\n3\n2 \u22124\n3x3\n \ndx\n= 768\n35\nExample 3:\nID =\n  \nD x3y dx dy where D is the\nregion enclosed by the ellipse x2\na2 + y2\nb2 = 1 in the\n\ufb01rst quadrant.\nFig. 7.5\nSolution:\nID =\n a\n0\n \nb\na\n\u221a\na2\u2212x2\ny=0\nx3y dy dx\nID =\n a\n0\nx3y2\n2\n     \nb\na\n\u221a\na2\u2212x2\n0\ndx = b2\n2a2\n a\n0\n(a2x3 \u2212x5)dx\nID = b2\n2a2\n \na2x4\n4\n\u2212x6\n6\n a\n0\n= b2a4\n24\nExample 4:\nID =\n  \nD x2dx dy where D is the re-\ngion in the \ufb01rst quadrant bounded by the hyperbola\nxy = 16 and the lines y = x, y = 0 and x = 8.\nSolution:\nIf horizontal strips are considered, the\nupper curve ABE consists of two curves AB and\nBE.

Let u, v be new variables in domain D\u2217such that\nx, y and u, v are connected through the continuous\nfunctions (transformations).\nx = g(u, v), y = h(u, v)\n(1)\nThen u, v are said to be curvilinear coordinates of\npoint P \u2217in D\u2217which uniquely corresponds to P in\nD. Solving (1) for u and v, we get\nu = g\u2217(x, y), v = h\u2217(x, y)\n(2)\nThen a given double integral in the given (old)\nvariables x, y can be transformed to a double integral\nin terms of new variables u, v as follows:\n  \nD\nf (x, y)dx dy =\n  \nD\u2217F(u, v)|J|du dv\n(3)\nHere\nf (x, y) = f (x(u, v),\ny(u, v)) = F(u, v)\nand J is the Jacobian (functional determinant) de-\n\ufb01ned as\nJ = J\n x, y\nu, v\n \n= \u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(u, v) =\n        \n\u2202x\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u2202v\n        \n(3) is knows as formula for transformation of coor-\ndinates in double integral.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nEvaluate\n  \nR(x + y)2dx dy where R\nis region bounded by the parallelogram x + y = 0,\nx + y = 2, 3x \u22122y = 0, 3x \u22122y = 3.\nSolution:\nBy changing the variables x, y to the new\nvariables u, v, by the substitution (transformation)\nx + y = u, 3x \u22122y = v, the given parallelogram R\nreduces to a rectangle R\u2217as shown in the (Fig.\n7.19):\n\u2202(u, v)\n\u2202(x, y) =\n        \n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n        \n=\n    \n1\n1\n3\n\u22122\n    = \u22125\nFig. 7.19\nSo required Jacobian J = \u2202(x,y)\n\u2202(u,v) = \u22121\n5.\nSince, u = x + y = 0 and u = x + y = 2,\nu varies from 0 to 2, while v varies from 0 to 3\nsince 3x \u22122y = v = 0, 3x \u22122y = v = 3.

Put x + y = u, y = v so that\nx = u \u2212v, y = v (Fig. 7.22).\nFig. 7.22\ni. Origin O(0, 0) in xy-plane: 0 = u \u2212v,\n0 = v, u = 0. Thus (0, 0) in xy-plane corre-\nsponds to (0, 0) in u, v-plane.\nii. x-axis: y = 0 i.e., v = 0, so x = u \u22120 = u\nsince x \u22650, u = x \u22650.\nThus x-axis gets transformed to u-axis\n(v = 0, u \u22650)\niii. y-axis: x = 0 so 0 = x = u \u2212v, so that u = v\nsince y \u22650, u = v = y \u22650.\nThus y-axis gets mapped to the line u = v in the\nuv-plane.\niv. Any point x > 0, y > 0.\nSince v = y > 0 and u \u2212v = x > 0 so that\nu > v.\nThus any point (x > 0, y > 0) corresponds to (u, v)\nwhere u > v > 0. Thus the entire \ufb01rst quadrant in\nxy-plane gets transformed to the region between\nu-axis and the line u = v.\n\n7.16\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014II\nThus\nI =\n  \nR\ne\u2212(x+y) sin\n \u03c0y\nx + y\n \ndx dy\n=\n \u221e\n0\n \u221e\n0\ne\u2212(x+y) sin\n \u03c0y\nx + y\n \ndy dx\n=\n \u221e\n0\n u\nv=0\ne\u2212u sin\n \u03c0v\nu\n \n\u00b7 1 \u00b7 dv du\nsince\nthe Jacobian = J = \u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(u, v) =\n        \n\u2202x\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u2202v\n        \n=\n     \n1 \u22121\n0\n1\n     = 1\n=\n \u221e\n0\ne\u2212u \u00b7\n \n\u2212cos \u03c0v\nu\n \n\u00b7 u\n\u03c0 \u00b7\n    \nu\n0\ndu\n=\n \u221e\n0\n\u2212u\n\u03c0 e\u2212u \u00b7 (\u22121 \u22121)du\n= 2\n\u03c0\n \u221e\n0\nue\u2212udu\n= 2\n\u03c0\n \nue\u22124\n\u22121 \u2212e\u2212u\n \u221e\n0\n= 2\n\u03c0\nExample 4:\n 1\n0\n x\n0\n \nx2 + y2dx dy\nSolution:\nRegion of integration R is the triangle\nbounded by y = 0, x = 1 and y = x (Fig. 7.23).\nFig. 7.23\nPut x = u, y = uv\nJ = Jacobian = \u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(u, v) =\n        \n\u2202x\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u2202v\n        \n=\n    \n1 0\nv u\n    = u\nIn the given region R, x: varies from 0 to 1 while y\nvaries from 0 to x.

Usually these equa-\ntions describing the system in motion are \"differen-\ntial equations\" involving derivatives which measures\nthe rates of change. The behaviour and interaction of\ncomponents of the system at later times is described\nby the \"solutions\" of these differential equations.\nIn this chapter we consider the simplest of\nthese differential equations which is of \ufb01rst or-\nder. We study the solutions of differential equations\nwhich are: variables separable, homogeneous, non-\nhomogeneous, exact, non-exact using integrating\nfactors, linear, Bernoulli, higher degree, Clairaut\u2019s,\nLagrange\u2019s. We consider geometrical applications\nand physical problems of law of natural growth, nat-\nural decay, Newton\u2019s law of cooling, velocity of es-\ncape from earth and simple electrical circuits.\n8.1\nINTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL\nMODELING\nScienti\ufb01cmodelisanabstractandsimpli\ufb01eddescrip-\ntion of a given phenomenon and is most often based\non mathematical structures.\nHistorically following the invention of calcu-\nlus by Newton (1642-1727) and Leibnitz (1646-\n1716), there is a burst of activity in mathemati-\ncal sciences. Early mathematical modeling problems\ninclude boundary value problems in vibration of\nstrings, elastic bars and columns of air due to Taylor\n(1685-1731), Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), Euler\n(1707-1783) and d\u2019Alembert (1717-1783).\nModeling is a technique of transforming a phys-\nical problem to a \u201cmathematical model\u201d. Thus a\nmathematical model describes a natural process or a\nphysical system in mathematical terms, representing\nan idealization by simplifying the reality by ignor-\ning negligible details of the natural process and em-\nphasizing on only its essential manifestations. Such\nmodel yielding reproducible results, can be used for\nprediction. Thus a mathematical model essentially\nexpresses a physical system in terms of a functional\nrelationship of the kind:\nDependent variable = function of independent\nvariables, parameters and forcing functions\nA model should be general enough to explain\nthe phenomenon but not too complicated precluding\nanalysis. Mathematical formulation of problems in-\nvolving continuously or discretely changing quanti-\nties leads to ordinary or partial differential equations,\nlinear or non-linear equations, integral equations or\na combination of these.\nExample of a Mathematical Model of a\nMechanical System\nConsider a mechanical oscillator consisting of a\nblock of a mass m lying on a table and restrained lat-\nerally by an ordinary spring. The displacement x(t)\nof the spring as a function of time t is governed by\n8.1\n\n8.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014III\nReady for prediction\nResults\nValidation\nSolution\nReal-world\nproblem\nMathematical\nmodel\nReject\nor\nrefine\nthat is\nmore\nacceptable\nModeling\nAnalysis\nInterpretation\nYES\nNO\nFig. 8.1\nScheme of mathematical modeling\na second order differential equation which arises out\nof the Newton\u2019s second law as follows:\n(mass)(acceleration) = sum of forces\nor\nmd2x\ndt2 = F \u2212Fs \u2212Ff \u2212Fa\nm\nx\nMechanical oscillator\nF\nFa\nFf\nFs\nFig. 8.2\nHere F(t), the applied force, is the forcing func-\ntion. The force Fs exerted by the spring on the mass\nis generally assumed to be of the form Fs(x) = kx;\nwhere k the spring stiffness is the parameter of the\nmaterial. The sliding friction force Ff exerted on\nthe bottom of the mass may be assumed to be pro-\nportional to the velocity i.e. Ff = c dx\ndt , where c is\nknown as the damping coef\ufb01cient, another parame-\nter. Neglecting the aerodynamic drag Fa we get an\napproximate model of the system described by\nmd2x\ndt2 = F \u2212kx \u2212cdx\ndt \u22120\nor\nmd2x\ndt2 + cdx\ndt + kx = f (t)\nThus the mathematical model of the physical me-\nchanical oscillator is described by a differential equa-\ntion which expresses the relationship between the\ndependent variable, x the displacement as a function\nof the independent variable t, the parameters k and c\nand the forcing F(x). Models representing the elec-\ntrical, chemical, mechanical, and civil systems are\nabundant.\nA mechanical system describing the forced oscil-\nlations of a mass-spring system and an electrical sys-\ntem describing an RLC-circuit are both represented\nby a linear second order non-homogeneous ordinary\ndifferential equation. This demonstrates the unifying\npower of \u201cmathematical modeling\u201d through which\nentirely different physical systems can be studied\nby the same mathematical model. The analogy be-\ntween mechanical and electrical systems simpli\ufb01es\nthe study of mechanical systems since the electrical\nsystems are easy to construct and easy to measure\naccurately.\nThe power of modeling is seen from the differen-\ntial equation\nd2x\ndt2 + \u03c92x = 0\nwhich represents simple harmonic motion, also the\nmotion of a particle with constant angular velocity\nalong a circle and also the free undamped vertical\nmotion of a mass-spring system and \ufb01nally the mo-\ntion of the bob of a simple pendulum in a vertical\nplane.\n8.2\nBASIC DEFINITIONS\nA \u201cdifferential equation\u201d (D.E.) is an equation in-\nvolving (connecting) an unknown (or sought-for)\nfunction y of one or more independent variables\nx, t, . . . and its derivatives.\nDifferential equations are classi\ufb01ed into two\ncategories \u201cordinary and partial\u201d depending on the\nnumber of independent variables appearing in the\nequation.\nOrdinary Differential Equation (O.D.E.)\nAn ordinary differential equation is a D.E. in which\nthe dependent variable y depends only on one inde-\n\nORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS: FIRST ORDER AND FIRST DEGREE\n8.3\npendent variable say x (so that the derivatives of y\nare ordinary derivatives).\nExample:\nF(x, y, y , y  , . . . , y(n)) = 0.\nNotation:\nThe \ufb01rst derivative dy\ndx is denoted by y ,\nsecond derivative d2y\ndx2 by y  , etc.\nPartial Differential Equation (P.D.E.)\nA partial differential equation is one in which y\ndepends on two or more independent variables\nsay x, t, . . . (so that the derivatives of y are partial\nderivatives.)\nExample:\nF\n\u0001\nx, t, y, \u2202y\n\u2202x , \u2202y\n\u2202t , \u22022y\n\u2202x2 , . . . ,\n\u2202my\n\u2202xk\u2202tl\n\u0002\n= 0.\nOrder\nof a D.E. is the order of the highest derivative ap-\npearing in the equation.\nDegree\nof a D.E. is the degree of the highest ordered deriva-\ntive (when the derivatives are cleared of radicals and\nfractions).\nLinear\nAn nth order O.D.E. in the dependent variable y is\nsaid to be linear in y if\ni. y and all its derivatives are of degree one.\nii. No product terms of y and/or any of it derivatives\nare present.\niii. No tanscendental functions of y and/or its deriva-\ntives occur.\nNon-linear\nO.D.E. is an O.D.E. that is not linear.

Otherwise the solution is said\nto be an implicit solution where F(x, y) = 0 where\nF(x, y) is an implicit function.\nNote 2:\nGeneral (or complete) solution of an nth\norder D.E. will have n arbitrary constants.\nParticular solution\nParticular solution is a solution obtained from the\ngeneral solution by choosing particular values of\nthe arbitrary constants. Integral curve of D.E. is the\ngraph of the general/particular solution of D.E.\nInitial (boundary) value problem\nInitial (boundary) value problem is one in which a\nsolution to a D.E. is obtained subject to conditions on\nthe unknown function and its derivative speci\ufb01ed at\none (two or more) value(s) of the independent vari-\nable.

Thus for the \ufb01rst or-\nder D.E., the general solution (G.S.) y = \u03c6(x, c)\ncontains one arbitrary constant C.

Here it is assumed that retardation\neffect due to air resistance and gravitational pull of\nother celestial bodies is neglected.\nLet m be the mass of the body and M be the mass\nof earth. Let r be the distance between the (centre of\nthe) earth and (the centre of gravity of) the body. Let\nR be the radius of earth.\nAccording to Newton\u2019s second law and the uni-\nversal law of gravitation and ignoring all forces (fric-\ntional, magnetic or other) except for gravity, the ver-\ntical motion of the body is described by the second\norder differential equation\nmd2r\ndt2 = \u2212k M \u00b7 m\nr2\n(1)\nwhere k is the gravitational constant. The minus sign\nindicates that the acceleration is negative.\nExpressing the acceleration in terms of velocity\nand distance d2r\ndt2 = dv\ndt = dv\ndr\ndr\ndt = v dv\ndr , the equation\n(1) can be written as\nv dv\ndr = \u2212kM\nr2\nHere v is the velocity of the body. Separating the\nvariables and integrating, we get\nv2\n2 = kM\nr\n+ c\n(2)\nSuppose v0 is the launching velocity with which the\nbody leavies the earth\u2019s surface then the initial con-\nditions are:\nfor t = 0, r = R, dr\ndt = v0\n(3)\nUsing (3) in (2), we have\nv2\n0\n2 = kM\nk + c or c =\nv2\n0\n2 \u2212kM\nR\nSubstituting c in (2), we get\nv2\n2 = kM\nr\n+ v2\n0\n2 \u2212kM\nR\nor\nv2 = 2kM\nr\n+\n\u0003\nv2\n0 \u22122kM\nR\n\u0004\n(4)\nAs r \u2192\u221e, kM\nr\n\u21920, the velocity is always positive\nif v2 > 0.

It depends only on M and R.\nFor radius of earth R = 63.107 cm and g = 981\ncm/sec2, the velocity of escape from earth is\nv0 =\n\t\n2(981)(63.107) \u224811.2.105 cm\n= 11.2 km/sec\nUsing (5) in (4) we get\nv2 = 2gR2\nr\n+ v2\n0 \u22122gR\n(7)\nThus the body projected with an initial (launching)\nvelocity v0 from the earth\u2019s surface in a radial di-\nrection will travel with velocity v given by (7). If\nv2\n0 < 2gR then for some critical value r, the velocity\nv given by (7) becomes zero, in which case the body\nwill stop and return to earth since the velocity will\nchange from positive to negative.\nCor: If the body is carried by a rocket and is sep-\narated from the rocket at a distance of r\u2217miles\nfrom the earth\u2019s surface then the velocity of escape\nv0 =\n\u0005\n2gr2\nR+r\u2217\nIn this case the differential equation is\nv dv\ndr = \u2212\nMg\n(R + r\u2217)2\nwhich on integrating gives\nv2 = 2R2g\nr\n+\n\u0003\nv2\n0 \u22122 R2g\nR + r\u2217\n\u0004\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nAssuming the radius of moon as R =\n1080 miles and acceleration of gravity at the surface\nof the moon as 0.165 g where g is the acceleration\nof gravity at the surface of the earth, determine the\nvelocity of escape for the moon.\nSolution:\nVelocity of escape v0 = \u221a2g\u2217R\u2217.

Electric current \ufb02ows due to a difference in\nthe electric potential or voltage measured in volts (v),\njust as heat \ufb02ows from one point to the other due to\na temperature difference. An electric circuit consists\nof a source of electric energy (electromotive force)\nand elements such as resistors, inductors or voltage\nand capacitors. A mathematical model of an electric\ncircuit is represented by linear (\ufb01rst or second order)\ndifferential equations. To form such an equation, the\nfollowing relationships are needed:\nThe voltage drop ER across a resistor is propor-\ntional to the instantaneous current I(t) through it:\nER = RI\n(Ohm\u2019s law)\n(1)\nHere t is the time and the constant of proportion-\nality R is known as the resistance of the resistor,\nmeasured in ohms (5). Resistor uses (consumes) en-\nergy. Resistor is represented by\n. The volt-\nage drop EL across an inductor is proportional to the\ninstantaneous time rate of change of the current:\nEL = LdI\ndt\n(2)\nHere the constant of proportionality L is known as\ninductance of the inductor and is measured in henrys\n(H). An inductor opposes a change in current and is\nrepresented by\n. Inductor causes inertia\neffect in electricity just as mass in mechanics. The\nvoltage drop Ec across a capacitor is proportional to\nthe instantaneous electric charge Q on the capacitor.\nEc = 1\nc Q\n(3)\nHere c is called the capacitance and is measured\nin farads (F) and is represented by\n. A capac-\nitor stores energy. The charge Q is measured in\ncoulombs. Since current is the time rate of change\nof charge,\nI(t) = dQ\ndt\n(4)\nEquation (3) may be written as\nEc = 1\nc\n\u0006 t\nt0\nI(u)du\n(5)\nTo determine the current I(t) in an electric cir-\ncuit, a differential equation is formed using the\nKirchhoff\u2019s\u2217voltage law (KVL) which states that\nthe algebraic sum of all the instantaneous voltage\ndrops around any closed loop is zero or the voltage\nimpressed on a closed loop is equal to the sum of the\nvoltage drops in the rest of the loop. Consider two\nsimple cases of series or one-loop electric circuits.\nI. RL-circuit\nBy (1), the voltage drop across the resistor is RI.\nBy (2), the voltage drop across the inductor is L dI\ndt .\nNow applying Kirchhoff\u2019s law to the RL-circuit, the\nsum of the two voltage drops must be equal to elec-\ntromotive force E(t). Thus the current I(t) in the\nRL-circuit is determined by the \ufb01rst order linear dif-\nferential equation\nL dI\ndt + RI = E(t) .\n(6)\nRewriting (6), we have\ndI\ndt + R\nLI = E(t)\nL\nwhich has an integrating factor e\n\u0017 R\nL dt = e\nR\nL t = e\u03b1t\nwhere \u03b1 = R\nL.\n\u2217Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), German physicist.\n\nORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS: FIRST ORDER AND FIRST DEGREE\n8.51\nE(t)\nR\nL\nRL-circuit\nFig. 8.9\nThen the general solution of (6) is\nI(t) \u00b7 e\u03b1t =\n\u0006 E(t)\nL\n\u00b7 e\u03b1tdt + c\nor\nI(t) = e\u2212\u03b1t \u0011\u0017 E(t)\nL \u00b7 e\u03b1tdt + c\n\u0012\n(7)\nCase (a): Suppose E = E0 = constant.

Higher order differential equations appear\nin problems involving de\ufb02ections of loaded beams\n(4th order), mechanical spring systems having sev-\neral springs connected in tandem or series of electri-\ncal circuits containing several loops. In this chapter,\nwe consider methods of obtaining solutions of ho-\nmogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equa-\ntions of second and higher order with constant coef\ufb01-\ncients. We also consider the Cauchy\u2019s and Legendre\ndifferential equations with variable coef\ufb01cients. We\npresent two powerful general methods: method of\nvariation of parameters and method of undetermined\ncoef\ufb01cients. Method of obtaining solution of system\nof simultaneous linear differential equations is pre-\nsented. Finally we consider four important engineer-\ning applications: the simple harmonic motion, mass-\nspring system, RLC-circuit and simple pendulum.\n9.1\nLINEAR INDEPENDENCE AND\nDEPENDENCE\nTwo functions y1(x) and y2(x) are said to be linearly\nindependent if\nk1y1(x) + k2y2(x) = 0\n(1)\nimplies k1 and k2 are both zeros i.e., when y1 or y2\ncan not be expressed as proportional to the other.\nOtherwise, y1 and y2 are linearly dependent if (1)\nholds for some constants k1 and k2 not both zero.\nCriterion for linear dependence or\nindependence of two functions y1 and y2\nDe\ufb01ne the Wronski* determinant or Wronskian\nw(y1, y2) =\n     \ny1\ny2\ny \n1\ny \n2\n     = y1y \n2 \u2212y2y \n1\n(2)\nResults:\ni. y1, y2 are linearly independent if w  = 0\nii. otherwise linearly dependent when w = 0.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nDetermine whether the following functions y1 and\ny2 are linearly dependent or independent:\nExample 1:\ny1 = cos ax, y2 = sin ax with a  = 0.\nSolution:\nw =\n     \ncos ax\nsin ax\n\u2212a sin ax\na cos ax\n     \n= a(cos2 ax + sin2 ax)\n= a  = 0\nSo y1 and y2 are linearly independent.\nExample 2:\ny1 = ln x, y2 = ln xn with n non neg-\native integer.\nSolution:\nw =\n      \nln x\nln xn\n1\nx\nnxn\u22121\nxn\n      \n= n\nx ln x \u22121\nx ln xn = 0\nSo y1 and y2 are linearly dependent.\n* I.M.

The\nderivatives of such functions F(x) have a form sim-\nilar to F(x) itself and are \ufb01nite in number. Although\nthe class of such functions F(x) is quite restricted,\nthey include functions of frequent occurrence.\nThis method is relatively simple. The particular\nintegral yp of (1) is assumed in a form similar to the\nR.H.S. function F(x) and involving undetermined\n(unknown) coef\ufb01cients which are then determined\nby substitution of yp in D.E. (1). The advantage of\nthis method is that for a wrong choice of yp, or with\nfew terms leads to contradiction, while choice of\ntoo many terms makes super\ufb02uous coef\ufb01cients zero.\nThus this method is self correcting. However, this\nmethod fails when F(x) = secx, tan x etc. since the\nnumber of new terms obtained by differentiation is\nin\ufb01nite. Table 9.4 gives the form (choice) of P.I. yp\nfor a speci\ufb01c F(x).\nProcedure:\nLet m1, m2, . . . , mn be the roots of auxiliary equa-\ntion f (m) = 0 where f (D)y = F(x) is the given\nD.E.

The simplest mechani-\ncal system is the mass-spring system which consists\nof a coil spring of natural length L, suspended verti-\ncally from a \ufb01xed point support (such as a ceiling or\nbeam). A constant mass \u2018m\u2019 attached to the lower end\nof the spring, stretches the spring to a length (L + e)\nand comes to rest which is known as the static equi-\nlibrium position. Here e > 0 is the static de\ufb02ection\ndue to the hanging the mass on the spring. Now the\nmass is set in motion either by pushing or pulling\n\nLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF SECOND ORDER AND HIGHER ORDER\n9.51\nthe mass from equilibrium position and/or by im-\nparting a non-zero velocity (downward or upward)\nto the mass (in the equilibrium position). Since the\nmotion takes place in the vertical direction, we con-\nsider the downward direction as positive. In order to\ndetermine the displacement x(t) of the mass from the\nstatic equilibrium position, we use Newton\u2019s second\nlaw and Hooke\u2019s law. The mass m is subjected to the\nfollowing forces:\n(a) a gravitational force mg acting downwards.\n(b) a spring restoring force \u2212k(x(t) + e) due to dis-\nplacement of the spring from rest (equilibrium)\nposition.\n(c) a frictional (or damping or resistance) force of the\nmedium, opposing the motion and of magnitude-\n\u2212cx.

Thus the D.E. modeling the motion of mass is\nm\u00a8x(t) + cx. (t) + kx(t) = F(t)\nwhich is a second order linear non-homogenous\nequation with constant coef\ufb01cients. The displace-\nment (or motion) of the mass at any time t is x(t)\nwhich is the solution of D.E. (1). Let us consider\nthree important cases of D.E. (1) referred to as free\nmotion, damped motion and forced motion.\nFree, Undamped Oscillations of a Spring\nIn the absence of external force (F(t) = 0) and ne-\nglecting the damping force (c = 0), D.E. (1) reduce\nto\nm\u00a8x + kx = 0\n(2)\nwhich is the harmonic oscillator equation. Putting\n\u03c92 = k\nm, the equation (2) takes the form\n\u00a8x + \u03c92x = 0\nwhose general solution is sinusoidal given by\nx(t) = c1 cos \u03c9t + c2 sin \u03c9t\n(3)\nIntroducing c1 = A cos \u03c6, c2 = \u2212A sin \u03c6, equation\n(3) can be rewritten as\nx = A cos \u03c6 cos \u03c9t \u2212A sin \u03c6 sin \u03c9t = A cos (\u03c9t + \u03c6)\ni.e.\nx(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n(4)\nwhere A =\n \nc2\n1 + c2\n2, tan \u03c6 = \u2212c2\nc1 . The constant A\nis called the amplitude of the motion and gives the\nmaximum (positive) displacement of the mass from\nits equilibrium position. Thus the free, undamped\nmotion of the mass is a simple harmonic motion,\nwhich is periodic. The period of motion is the time\ninterval between two successive maxima and is given\nby\nT = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0\n m\nk\nThe natural frequency (or simply frequency) of the\nmotion (or harmonic oscillator) is the reciprocal\n\n9.52\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014III\nof the period, which gives the number of oscilla-\ntions/second. Thus the natural frequency is the un-\ndemped frequency (i.e. frequency of the system with\nout damping)\nFree, Damped Motion of a Mass\nEvery system has some damping, otherwise the sys-\ntem continues to move forever. Damping force op-\nposes oscillations. Damping not only decreases the\namplitude but also alters the natural frequency of the\nsystem. With external force absent (F(t) = 0) and\ndamping present (c  = 0), the D.E. (1) takes the form\nm\u00a8x + cx. + kx = 0\n(5)\nwhose auxiliary equation is\nr2 + 2br + \u03c92 = 0\n(6)\nHere 2b = c\nm and \u03c92 = k\nm.

The general solution is\nx(t) = c1er1t + c2er2t\n(8)\nwhich tends to zero as t \u2192\u221e. Thus the damping is\nso great that no oscillations can occur. The motion\n(or system) is said to be over critically damped (or\nsimply overdamped).\nCase (ii) b2 \u2212\u03c92 = 0 or b = \u03c9. Here both the roots\nare equal, real negative number \u2212b. The general so-\nlution is\nx(t) = (c1 + c2t)e\u2212bt\n(9)\nwhich tends to zero as t \u2192\u221e. Thus the damping is\njust enough to prevent oscillations so that the motion\nis no longer oscillatory. In this case the motion is said\nto be critically damped.\nIn both cases (i) and (ii) the displacement x(t)\nis asymptotic and approaches zero (the equilibrium\nposition) as t \u2192\u221e.\nCase (iii) when b < \u03c9 then b2 \u2212\u03c92 < 0 so the roots\nof the auxiliary equation (7) are complex conjugate\ngiven by \u2212b \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03c92 \u2212b2 i.

Resonance never\noccurs in this case since the frequency of the free\ndamped system\n\u221a\n\u03c92\u2212b2\n2\u03c0\n=\n1\n2\u03c0\n \nk\nm \u2212\nc2\n4m2 is less than\nthe natural frequency\n1\n2\u03c0\n \nk\nm of the corresponding\nundamped system. In this case the motion is said to\nbe underdamped. The free underdamped solutions\ngiven by (10) or (11) are also known as damped har-\nmonic motion.\nForced Oscillations\nIn the presence of an external force F(t), also known\nas input or driving force, the solutions of D.E. (1)\nare known as output or response of the system to\nthe external force. In this case, the oscillations are\nsaid to be forced oscillations, which are of two types\ndamped forced oscillations and undamped forced os-\ncillations.\n\nLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF SECOND ORDER AND HIGHER ORDER\n9.53\nCase (i): Damped forced oscillations\nThe D.E. in this case is\nm\u00a8x + cx. + kx = F(t)\n(1)\nSuppose the external impressed forces F(t) is a peri-\nodic sinusoidal force with amplitude F1 and circular\nfrequency \u03b2 of the form\nF(t) = F1 cos \u03b2t,\n(F1 > 0; \u03b2 > 0)\nThen D.E.

The second term xp in\n(15) given by (14), known as steady-state term repre-\nsents a simple harmonic motions of period, 2\u03c0\n\u03b2 which\nresults from the presence of the external force F(t)\nwhose period is also 2\u03c0\n\u03b2 . Hence after a suf\ufb01ciently\nlong time, the output corresponding to a purely si-\nnusoidal input will be practically a harmonic oscil-\nlation whose frequency is that of the input.\nCase (ii): Undamped forced oscillations:\nResonance\nIn the undamped case c = 0 and D.E. (1) takes the\nform\nm\u00a8x + kx = F(t) = F1 cos \u03b2t\nor\n\u00a8x + \u03c92x = E1 cos \u03b2t\n(16)\nwhere \u03c92 = k\nm, E1 = F1\nm and \u03c9, E1, \u03b2 are positive\nconstants. The complementary function of (16) is\nxc = c1 cos \u03c9t + c2 sin \u03c9t\n(17)\nThus every free solution (17) of D.E. (16) is periodic\nwith frequency \u03c9. The frequency of the driving force\nin (16) is of frequency \u03b2. Now we study the nature\nof solution of D.E. (16).\nWhen \u03c9 = \u03b2: In this case the particular integral\nof D.E.

Thus RHS of (12) is zero and\nhence the result.\nCorollary:\nEigenvalues and eigen functions of the\nSturm-Liouville Theorem are real.\nProof:\nSuppose the eigenvalue \u03bb = \u03b1 + i\u03b2 is com-\nplex; with y as the corresponding eigen function.\nThen \u03bb is the eigen value with y as the correspond-\ning eigen function. Taking conjugate of (1), (2), (3),\nwe get\nd\ndx\n \nr(x)dy\ndx\n \n+ [q(x) + \u03bbP (x)]y = 0\nd\ndx\n \nr(x)d y\ndx\n \n+ [q(x) + \u03bbP(x)]y = 0\nsince r(x), q(x), P(x) are all real and\nk1y(a) + k2y  (a) = 0\nl1y(b) + l2y  (b) = 0\nThus the nontrivial solution y is the eigen function\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb. If \u03b2  = 0 then \u03bb\nand \u03bb are distinct. So by the Sturm-Liouville theo-\nrem, y and y should be orthogonal on [a, b] w.r.t. the\nweight function P (x). Thus\n b\na\nP(x)y(x)y(x)dx = 0\nor\n b\na\nP(x)(u2 + v2)dx = 0\nBut since P(x) > 0 and yy = u2 + v2 > 0 so the\nabove integral should have positive value. This con-\ntradiction is due to the wrong assumption that \u03b2  = 0.\nSo \u03b2 = 0 or \u03bb is real.

The crucial\nidea which made the Laplace* transform (L.T.) a very\npowerful technique is that it replaces operations of\ncalculus by operations of algebra. For example, with\nthe application of Laplace transform to an initial\nvalue problem, consisting of an ordinary (or partial)\ndifferential equation (O.D.E.) together with initial\nconditions (I.C.) is reduced to a problem of solving\nan algebraic equation (with any given initial condi-\ntions automatically taken care) as shown in Fig. 12.1.\n12.1\nLAPLACE TRANSFORM\nDe\ufb01nition:\nLet f (t) be a given function de\ufb01ned\nfor all t \u22650.

The\noriginal given function f (t) known as determining\nfunction depends on t, while the new function to\nbe determined F(s), called as generating function,\ndepends only on s (because the improper integral on\nthe R.H.S. of (1) is integrated with respect to t).\nF(s) in (1) is known as the Laplace transform of\nf (t).\nEquation (1) is known as direct transform or\nsimply transform, in which f (t) is given and F(s)\nis to be determined.\nThus Laplace transform transforms one class of\ncomplicated functions f (t) to produce another class\nof simpler functions F(s).\nNotation:\nOriginal given functions are denoted by\nlower case letters say f (t) and their Laplace trans-\nforms by the same letters in capitals say F(s).

With the application of Laplace transform,\nparticular solution of differential equation (D.E.)\nis obtained directly without the necessity of \ufb01rst\ndetermining general solution and then obtaining\nthe particular solution (by substitution of initial\nconditions).\n2. L.T. solves non-homogeneous D.E. without\nthe necessity of \ufb01rst solving the corresponding\nhomogeneous D.E.\n3. L.T. is applicable not only to continuous func-\ntions but also to piecewise continuous functions,\ncomplicated periodic functions, step functions\nand impulse functions.\n4. Laplace transforms of various functions are\nreadily available (in tabulated form). In Section\n12.12 Laplace transforms of some most often\nused functions are tabulated.\nSuf\ufb01cient Conditions for the Existence of\nLaplace Transform of f (t)\nThe L.T. of f (t) exists i.e., the improper integral in\nthe R.H.S. of (1) converges (has a \ufb01nite value) when\nthe following suf\ufb01cient conditions are satis\ufb01ed:\na. f (t) is piecewise (or sectionally) continuous i.e.,\nf (t) is continuous in every subinterval and has\n\ufb01nite limits at end points of each of these sub-\nintervals and\nb. f (t) is of exponential order of \u03b3 i.e., there ex-\nists M, \u03b3 such that |f (t)| < Me\u03b3 t. In other words\nfunctions of exponential order do not grow faster\nthan e\u03b3 t.\nExample:\nSince lim\nt\u2192\u221e\nt2\ne3t = \ufb01nite, f (t) = t2 is of\nexponential order say 3.\nExample:\nSince lim\nt\u2192\u221e\net2\ne\u03b3 t = not \ufb01nite, f (t) = et2\nis not of exponential order.\nNote:\nAbove conditions (a) and (b) are not neces-\nsary conditions.\n12.3\nGENERAL PROPERTIES OF\nLAPLACE TRANSFORM\nAlthough theoretically F(s), the Laplace transform\nof f (t) is obtained from the de\ufb01nition (1) (in\nSection 12.2), in practice most of the time Laplace\ntransforms are obtained by the judicial application\nof some of the following important properties. In a\nnutshell, they are:\n1. Linearity property states that L.T. of a linear com-\nbination (sum) is the linear combination (sum) of\nLaplace transforms.\n2. In change of scale, where the argument t of f is\nmultiplied by a constant a, s is replaced by s\na in\nF(s) and then multiplied by 1\na .\n\n12.4\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014III\n3. First shift theorem proves that multiplication of\nf (t) by eat amounts to replacement of s by s \u2212a\nin F(s).\n4. L.T. of a derivative f  amounts to multiplication\nof F(s) by s (approximately but for the constant\n\u2212f (0)).\n5. L.T. of an integral of f amounts to division of\nF(s) by s.\n6. Multiplication of f (t) by tn amounts to differ-\nentiation of F(s) n times w.r.t. s (with (\u22121)n as\nsign).\n7. Division of f (t) by t amounts to integration of\nF(s) between the limits s to \u221e.\n8. Second shift theorem proves that the L.T. of\nshifted function f (t \u2212a)u(t \u2212a) is obtained by\nmultiplying F(s) by e\u2212at. The above important\nproperties are tabulated in Section 12.12.\nLinearity Property (Principle)\nBook Work: If L{f (t)}=F(s) and L{g(t)}=G(s)\nThen\nL{c1f (t) + c2g(t)} = c1L{f (t)} + c2L{g(t)}\n= c1F(s) + c2G(s)\nwhere c1 and c2 are any two constants.\nProof:\nL{c1f (t) + c2g(t)}\n=\n \u221e\n0\ne\u2212st{c1f (t) + c2g(t)}dt\n= c1\n \u221e\n0\ne\u2212stf (t)dt + c2\n \u221e\n0\ne\u2212stg(t)dt\n= c1L{f (t)} + c2L{g(t)}\n= c1F(s) + c2G(s).\nThus Laplace transform is a linear operator, addi-\ntive and homogeneous (like the differential operator\nD =\nd\ndx ).\nThis result can easily be generalized to more than\ntwo functions.\nExample:\nFind L{cosh at}\nSolution:\nL{cosh at} = L\n \neat+e\u2212at\n2\n \nBy Linearity property\nL{cosh at} = 1\n2L{eat} + 1\n2L{e\u2212at}\nL{cosh at} = 1\n2\n1\ns \u2212a + 1\n2\n1\ns + a =\ns\ns2 \u2212a2 , s > a \u22650.\nSimilarly,\nExample:\nL{sinh at} =\na\ns2\u2212a2\nExample:\nL{eiwt} =\n1\ns \u2212iw =\ns + iw\n(s \u2212iw)(s + iw) = s + iw\ns2 + w2\nsince ei\u03b8 = cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8, by linearity property\nL{eiwt} = L{cos wt + i sin wt}\n= L{cos wt} + iL{sin wt}\n= s + iw\ns2 + w2\nComparing the real and imaginary parts on both\nsides, we have\nL{cos wt} =\ns\ns2 + w2\nand\nL{sin wt} =\nw\ns2 + w2 .\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nLinearity property\nFind the Laplace transform of the following:\nExample 1:\neat \u2212ebt\nSolution:\nL{eat \u2212ebt} = L{eat} \u2212L{ebt}\n=\n1\ns \u2212a \u2212\n1\ns \u2212b =\na \u2212b\n(s \u2212a)(s \u2212b)\nExample 2:\ncos2 kt\nSolution:\nL{cos2 kt} = L\n 1 + cos 2kt\n2\n \n= 1\n2L{1} + 1\n2L{cos 2kt} = 1\n2\n1\ns + 1\n2\ns\ns2 + 4k2 .\n\nLAPLACE TRANSFORM\n12.5\nExample 3:\n(5e2t \u22123)2\nSolution:\nL{(5e2t \u22123)2} = L{25e4t \u221230e2t + 9}\n= 25L{e4t} \u221230L{e2t} + 9L{1}\n= 25 \u00b7\n1\ns \u22124 \u221230\n1\ns \u22122 + 9 \u00b7 1\ns .\nExample 4:\n3t4 \u22122t3 +4e\u22123t \u22122 sin 5t +3 cos 2t\nSolution:\nL{3t4 \u22122t3 + 4e\u22123t \u22122 sin 5t + 3 cos 2t}\n= 3L{t4} \u22122L{t3} + 4L{e\u22123t} \u22122L{sin 5t}\n+3L{cos 2t}\n= 34!\nt5 \u221223!\nt4 + 4\n1\ns + 3 \u22122 \u00b7\n5\ns2 + 52 + 3 \u00b7\ns\ns2 + 22 .\nExample 5:\ncos \u221at\nSolution:\nExpanding in series\ncos\n\u221a\nt =\n\u221e\n \nn=0\n(\u22121)n(t\n1\n2 )2n\n(2n)!\n=\n (\u22121)n\n(2n)! tn\nL{cos\n\u221a\nt} = L\n  (\u22121)n\n(2n)! tn\n \nBy linearity principle\n=\n \nL\n (\u22121)n\n(2n)! tn\n \n=\n\u221e\n \nn=0\n(\u22121)n\n(2n)!

Gauss-Jordan elimination produces both solu-\ntion for one or more R.H.S. vector B and also A\u22121.\nIts principal weakness is (i) it requires all RHS B\nto be stored and manipulated and (ii) when A\u22121 is\nnot required. The usefulness of Gaussian elimina-\ntion with back substitution is primarily pedagogi-\ncal. It stands between full elimination schemes such\nas Gauss-Jordan and triangular decomposition. LU-\ndecomposition or triangular decomposition (triangu-\nlar factorization) is a different approach in which the\ncoef\ufb01cient matrix A is factored into the product of\na lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular\nmatrix U i.e.,\nA = LU.\nSince a matrix that is either upper triangular or\nlower triangular is called \u201ctriangular\u201d, so LU-\ndecomposition is also referred to as triangular fac-\ntorization. LU method can be easily adopted to solve\na system with new R.H.S. B with great economy of\neffort.\nIt is popular because storage of space can be econ-\nomized and accumulates sums in double precision\n(Example: LINPAK (1979) computer program of Ar-\ngonne National Labs).\nSolution of Linear System by\nLU-Decomposition\nA non singular matrix A is said to have a triangu-\nlar factorization or LU-decomposition if A can be\nexpressed as the product of a lower triangular ma-\ntrix L with ones on its main diagonal and an upper\ntriangular matrix U. i.e.,\nA = LU\nFor n = 4, we have A4\u00d74 = L4\u00d74U4\u00d74\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\na11 a12 a13 a14\na21 a22 a23 a24\na31 a32 a33 a34\na41 a42 a43 a44\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n1\n0\n0\n0\nl21\n1\n0\n0\nl31 l32\n1\n0\nl41 l42 l43 1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nu11 u12 u13 u14\n0\nu22 u23 u24\n0\n0\nu33 u34\n0\n0\n0\nu44\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\nThe condition of non singularity of A implies that\nukk  = 0 for all k. Now consider the system of equa-\ntions\nAX = B\nor\nLUX = B\nPut Y = UX then\nLY = B\nand\nUX = Y\nSolve \ufb01rst LY = B for Y using forward substitution\nand then solve UX = Y for X using backward sub-\nstitution. Here X is the required solution vector.\nLU-decomposition is also known as Doolittle\u2019s\nmethod. Another variation of LU-decomposition is\ncrout\u2019s reduction or Cholosky\u2019s reduction in which\nthe upper triangular matrix U has ones on its main di-\nagonal (instead of L) in the triangular decomposition\nA = LU\nNote that LU decompostion is not unique.

such that AX is a scalar multiple of X say\nAX = \u03bbX. Then geometrically each vector on the\nline through the origin determined by X gets mapped\nback onto the same line under multiplication by A.\nThe algebraic eigen value problem consists of deter-\nmination of such vectors X, known as eigen vectors,\nsuch scalars \u03bb, known as eigen values. Thus the \ufb01nd-\ning of non zero vectors that get mapped into scalar\nmultiples of themselves under a linear operator are\nmost important in the study of vibrations of beams,\nprobability (Markov process), Economics (Leontief\nmodel), genetics, quantum mechanics, population\ndynamics and geometry. For example in a mechan-\nical system, they represent the normal modes of vi-\nbration. EISPACK is a package of programs in FOR-\nTRAN for solving eigen value problems [Smith et. al\n(1976) in \u201cMatrix Eigen-system routines-EISPACK\nguide\u201d, Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 6,\nSpringer-Verlag, New York].\n14.1\nLINEAR TRANSFORMATION\nConsider a set of n linear equations\ny1 = a11x1 + a12x2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + a1nxn\ny2 = a21x1 + a22x2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + a2nxn\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nyn = an1x1 + an2x2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + annxn\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\n(1)\nLety=[y1, y2, y3, . . ., yn]T , X=[x1, x2, x3, . . ., xn]T\nA =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\na11\na12\na13\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\na1n\na21\na22\na23\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\na2n\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nan1\nan2\nan3\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nann\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\nn\u00d7n\nThen set of n equations (1) can be represented as\nY = AX\n(2)\nwhich transforms the set of n variables (x1, x2,\n. . . , xn) to the set of n variables (y, y2, . . . , yn). Thus\n(2) is a transformation which transforms X into Y.\nHere A is known as the matrix of the transformation.\nLinear transformation\n(2) is said to be linear if it is additive and homoge-\nneous i.e.,\nA(c1X1 + c2X2) = c1AX1 + c2AX2\n= c1Y1 + c2Y2\nwhere c1 and c2 are constants.

(6) is known as the characteristic\nequation of A. Thus eigen values of n- square matrix\nA are the roots of the characteristic Equation (6).\nHence A can have at least one and at most n eigen\nvalues.\nDegree of characteristic polynomial = order of\nmatrix A.\nSpectrum of A is the set of all eigen values of A.\nThe eigen vector X corresponding to an eigen\nvalue \u03bb is obtained by solving the homogeneous sys-\ntem (4) with this known eigen value \u03bb. However\neigen vector X is not unique, since kX is also an\neigen vector where k  = 0 constant (AX = \u03bbX, mul-\ntiplying by k, kAX = k\u03bbX or A(kX) = \u03bb(kX). Thus\nkX is an eigen vector of A).\nNote 1:\nIf all the n eigen values of A are distinct,\nthen there correspond n distinct linearly independent\neigen vectors.\nNote 2:\nFor an eigen value of A, repeated (twice\nor more), there may correspond one or several lin-\nearlyindependenteigenvectors.Thusthesetofeigen\nvectors may or may not form a set of n linearly\nindependent vectors.\nNote 3:\nAlgebraic multiplicity of an eigen value\n\u03bb is the order of the eigen value as a root of the\ncharacteristic polynomial (i.e., if \u03bb is a double root\nthen algebraic multiplicity is 2).\nNote 4:\nGeometric multiplicity of \u03bb is the number\nof linearly independent eigen vectors corresponding\nto \u03bb.\nProcedure to Obtain Eigen Values and Eigen\nVectors\n1.

But X1  = 0 (eigen vectors are\nchosen to be non-zero). Hence a contradiction.\n13. Eigen values of diagonal, upper triangular\nor lower triangular matrices are the principal\ndiagonal\nelements\nsince\nthe\ncharacteristic\npolynomial becomes the product of diagonal\nelements namely\n|D \u2212\u03bbI| = (a11 \u2212\u03bb)(a22 \u2212\u03bb)(a33 \u2212\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (ann \u2212\u03bb).\nThus characteristic values are the diagonal\nelements aii.\n14. If \u03bb is an eigen value of an orthogonal matrix A\nthen 1\n\u03bb is also an eigen value of A. By de\ufb01nition\nof orthogonal matrix, AT = A\u22121. But A and\nAT have same eigen values. Also eigen values\nof A\u22121 are reciprocals of eigen values of A.\nThus if \u03bb is an eigen value of A then 1\n\u03bb is eigen\nvalue of A\u22121 = AT . Since A and AT has same\neigen values, \u03bb and 1\n\u03bb are eigen values of A.\n15.

The three\nsurfaces q1 = c1, q2 = c2 and q3 = c3, (refer Fig.\n15.2)where c1, c2, c3 are constants, are known as\n\u201ccoordinate surfaces\u201d of the system of curvilinear\ncoordinates. On these coordinates surfaces, say q1 =\nc1, one of the coordinates, here q1, remains constant.\nThe \u201ccoordinate curves (lines) (axis)\u201d are the\ncurves (or lines) of intersection of any two coor-\ndinate surfaces. Thus on the coordinate curve say\nwhich is the intersection of q2 = c2 and q3 = c3, only\nq1 varies, while q2 and q3 remain constant. Suppose\nthe rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) of any point P\nin space be expressed as functions of (q1, q2, q3) so\nthat\nx = x(q1, q2, q3), y = y(q1, q2, q3),\nz = z(q1, q2, q3)\n(1)\nSolving (1) for q1, q2, q3 in terms of x, y, z, we get\nq1 = q1(x, y, z), q2 = q2(x, y, z),\nq3 = q3(x, y, z)\n(2)\nThe set of Equations (1) and (2) are known as \u201ctrans-\nformation of coordinates\u201d.\nFig. 15.2\nIf the coordinate surfaces intersect at right an-\ngles (and therefore the coordinate lines are at right\nangles), then the curvilinear coordinate system is\nknown as \u201corthogonal curvilinear system of coor-\ndinates\u201d.\nLet e1, e2, e3 be unit vectors directed along the\ntangents to the coordinates axes q1, q2, q3 at the\npoint P in the direction of increasing q1, q2, q3 re-\nspectively, such that e1, e2, e3 form a right-handed\ntrihedral (triad).\nExample:\nRectangular cartesian coordinate\nsystem x, y, z, where the three coordinate surfaces\nare planes x = c1, y = c2, z = c3 which are mutu-\nally at right angles.\nNote:\nThe basic difference between curvilinear\ncoordinates and cartesian coordinates is that the unit\nvectors i, j, k in the cartesian coordinate system re-\nmain constant and are same for all points of space,\nwhile in any other system the unit vectors e1, e2, e3,\ngenerally speaking, are not constant i.e., change their\ndirectionswhenpassingfromonepointPtotheother.\nExample:\nCylindrical\ncoordinates\n(refer\nFig. 15.3)\nFig. 15.3\nq1 = r,\n0 \u2264r < \u221e\nq2 = \u03b8,\n0 \u2264\u03b8 < 2\u03c0\nq3 = z,\n\u2212\u221e< z < +\u221e\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n(3)\ncoordinate surfaces are\nr = constant: circular cylinders coaxial with\nz-axis\n\u03b8 = constant: half\nplane,\nadjoining\nz-axis,\nthrough z-axis\nz = constant: plane perpendicular to z-axis\n\n15.22\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014IV\ncoordinate lines (or axes) are\nr: rays with origin on z-axis and perpendicular to\nz-axis\n\u03b8: circles with centre on z-axis and lying in planes\nperpendicular to z-axis\nz: straight lines parallel to the z-axis\nThe transformation that relate cartesian coordi-\nnates to cylindrical coordinates are\nx = r cos \u03b8\ny = r sin \u03b8\nz = z\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n(4)\nr =\n \nx2 + y2, \u03b8 = arc tan y\nx , z = z\nExample:\nSpherical coordinates (see Fig. 15.4)\nFig. 15.4\nq1 = r,\n0 \u2264r < +\u221e\nq2 = \u03b8,\n0 \u2264\u03b8 \u2264\u03c0\n(5)\nq3 = \u03c6,\n0 \u2264\u03c6 < 2\u03c0\nThe coordinate surfaces are\nr = c1, spheres centred at origin 0\n\u03b8 = c2, circular half-angle cones with z-axis with\nvertex at origin.\n\u03c6 = c3, (half) planes adjoining the z-axis through\nz-axis.\ncoordinate lines are:\nr: rays emanating from origin 0\n\u03b8: meridians on a sphere\n\u03c6: parallel on a sphere\ncartesian coordinates are related to spherical coordi-\nnates as follows:\nx = r cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8\ny = r sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8\nz = r cos \u03b8.\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n(6)\nUnit Vectors in Curvilinear System\nSuppose r = r(q1, q2, q3) be the position vector of a\npoint P.

It\nhas applications in \ufb02uid \ufb02ow, design of underwater\ntransmission cables, heat \ufb02ow in stars, study of\nsatellites. Line integrals are useful in the calculation\nof work done by variable forces along paths in space\nand the rates at which \ufb02uids \ufb02ow along curves (circu-\nlation) and across boundaries (\ufb02ux). In this chapter\nwe consider three important integral theorems.\nGreen\u2019s theorem, a great theorem of calculus, which\nconverts line integrals to double integrals, evaluates\n\ufb02ow and \ufb02ux integrals across closed plane curves\nin non-conservative vector \ufb01elds. Stokes theorem\nstates that the circulation of a vector \ufb01eld around the\nboundary of a surface in space equals the integral of\nthe normal component of the curl of the \ufb01eld over\nthe surface. Gauss divergence theorem, which is im-\nportant in electricity, magnetism and \ufb02uid \ufb02ow, says\nthat the outward \ufb02ux of a vector \ufb01eld across a closed\nsurface equals the triple integral of the divergence\nof the \ufb01eld over the region enclosed by the surface.\n16.1\nVECTOR INTEGRATION:\nINTEGRATION OF A VECTOR\nFUNCTION OF A SCALAR\nARGUMENT\nDe\ufb01nitions\nPrimitive\nA vector function F(u) is the primitive of the vector\nfunction f (u) if\ndF(u)\ndu\n= f (u)\nInde\ufb01nite integral\nInde\ufb01nite integral of the vector function f = f (u) of\na scalar argument u is the collection of all primitive\nfunctions of f (u) and is denoted by\n \nf (u)du =\n dF(u)\ndu\ndu = F(u) + c\nwhere c is an arbitrary constant vector.\nProperties\n1.\n \n\u03b1f (u)du = \u03b1\n \nf (u)du,\n(\u03b1 = numerical constant)\n2.\n \n[f (u) \u00b1 g(u)]du =\n \nf (u)du \u00b1\n \ng(u)du\n3.

It is very useful in the study of heat\nconduction, mechanics, concentrations of chemicals\nand pollutants, electrostatics, acoustics and in areas\nunheard of in Fourier\u2019s day such as computing and\nCAT scan (computer assisted tomography).\nFourier* series is an in\ufb01nite series representation\nof periodic function in terms of the trigonometric\nsine and cosine functions. Fourier series is very\npowerful method to solve ordinary and partial differ-\nential equations particularly with periodic functions\nappearing\nas\nnon-homogeneous\nterms.\nWhile\nTaylor\u2019s series expansion is valid only for functions\nwhich are continuous and differentiable, Fourier\nseries is possible not only for continuous functions\nbut for periodic functions, functions discontinuous in\ntheir values and derivatives. Further, because of the\nperiodic nature, Fourier series constructed for one\nperiod is valid for all values. Harmonic analysis is\nthe theory of expanding functions in Fourier series.\nPeriodic Function\nA function f (x) is said to be periodic if f (x + T ) =\nf (x) for all real x and for some positive number T.\nT is known as the period of f (x).\n* Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768\u20131830), French physicist\nand mathematician.\nFundamental period\nor primitive period or simply period of f (x) is the\nsmallest positive period of f.\nExample:\ncos x, sin x, sec x, cosec x, are periodic\nfunctions with period 2\u03c0.\ntan x, cot x are periodic with period \u03c0.\nResult 1:\nIf T is the period of f (x) then nT is also\nperiod of f for any integer n.\ni.e.\nf (x + nT ) = f (x)\n(n  = 0)\nExample:\ncos(x + 4\u03c0) = cos(x + 2 \u00b7 2\u03c0) = cos((x\n+ 2\u03c0) + 2\u03c0) = cos(x + 2\u03c0) = cos 2\u03c0.\nResult 2:\nThe function h(x) = af (x) + bg(x) has\nperiod T if f (x) and g(x) have period T. Here a, b\nare constants.\nExample:\nIf h(x) = a cos x + b sin x, then\nh(x + 2\u03c0) = a cos(x + 2\u03c0) + b sin(x + 2\u03c0)\n= a cos x + b sin x = h(x).\nResult 3:\nIf f (x) is a periodic function of period\nT, then f (ax) with a  = 0, is a periodic function of\nperiod T\na .\nExample:\nsin 2x has period 2\u03c0\n2 = \u03c0\ncos 3x has period 2\u03c0\n3 and so on.\nResult 4:\nThe period of a sum of a number of pe-\nriodic functions is the least common multiple of the\nperiods.\nExample:\nf (x) = sin x + 1\n2 sin 2x + 1\n3 sin 3x +\n1\n4 sin 4x.

Now we consider the\nprocedure to expand a non-periodic function f (x)\nde\ufb01ned in half of the above interval say (0, L) of\nlength L. Such expansions are known as half range\nexpansions or half range Fourier series. In partic-\nular, a half range expansion containing only cosine\nterms is known as half range Fourier cosine series\nof f (x) in the interval (0, L). In a similar way half\nrange Fourier sine series contains only sine terms.\nNote that the given function f (x) is neither\nperiodic nor even nor odd. In order to obtain a\nFourier cosine series for f (x) in the interval (0, L),\nwe construct (de\ufb01ne) a new function g(x) such that\ni. g(x) \u2261f (x) in the interval (0, L) (Fig. 17.4)\nii. g(x) is even function in (\u2212L, L) and is periodic\nwith period 2L. (Fig. 17.5)\nSuch a function g(x) is known as the \u201ceven periodic\ncontinuation (or extension) of f (x)\u201d. The Fourier\ncosine series for g(x) valid in (\u2212L, L) (or in fact\nfor all x) is readily obtained as\ng(x) = a0\n2 +\n\u221e\n \nn=1\nan cos\n n\u03c0x\nL\n \n(1)\nwhere\na0 = 2\nL\n L\n0\ng(x)dx = 2\nL\n L\n0\nf (x)dx\n(2)\n\nFOURIER SERIES\n17.15\nan = 2\nL\n L\n0\ng(x) cos n\u03c0x\nL dx\nor\nan = 2\nL\n L\n0\nf (x) cos\n n\u03c0x\nL\n \ndx\n(3)\nSince by construction f (x) and g(x) are equal in\n(0, L), the required half-range Fourier cosine series\n(or half-range expansion in cosines) of f (x) is given\nby (1) with a0, an given by (2) and (3).\nFig. 17.5\nFig. 17.4\nHere\ng(x) = f (x)\nin (0, L)\n= f (\u2212x)\nin (\u2212L, 0)\nImportant Note:\nThe series expansion of f (x)\ngiven by (1) is valid for f (x) only in the interval\n(0, L) but not outside this interval.\nIn a similar way, to obtain the half-range Fourier\nsine series (or half range expansion in sines) for f (x)\nin (0, L), de\ufb01ne g(x) such that\ni. g(x) = f (x) in (0, L) (refer Fig. 17.6) and\nii. g(x) is an odd function in (\u2212L, L), (refer Fig.\n17.7) periodic with priod 2L.\nFig. 17.6\nFig. 17.7\nOdd Periodic\nThe new function g(x) is called as on odd periodic\ncontinuation of f (x).

This expansion (4) is valid for f (x) only in the\ninterval (0, L). Thus a given non-periodic function\nf (x) can be expanded in cosine series or sine series.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1: If f (x) = 1 \u2212x\nL in 0 < x < L \ufb01nd\n(a) Fourier cosine series (b) Fourier sine series of\n\n17.16\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014V\nf (x).

In this chapter, we\nderive and solve by separation of variables tech-\nnique some of the most important PDE\u2019s of one-\ndimensional heat equation, wave equation, Laplace\u2019s\nequation in two dimensions and in polar coordinates,\ntwo-dimensional heat equation, wave equation, vi-\nbrations of circular membrane, transmission lines.\nUnlike the ordinary differential equations, the gen-\neral solution of PDE\u2019s involve arbitrary functions\nwhich require the knowledge of single and double\nFourier series.\n19.1\nMETHOD OF SEPARATION OF\nVARIABLES\nSeparation of variables is a powerful technique to\nsolve P.D.E. For a P.D.E. in the function u of two\nindependent variables x and y, assume that the re-\nquired solution is separable, i.e.,\nu(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n(1)\nwhere X(x) is a function of x alone and Y(y) is a\nfunction of y alone. Then substitution of u from (1)\nand its derivatives reduces the P.D.E. to the form\nf (X, X , X  , . . .) = g(Y, Y  , Y   , . . .)\n(2)\nwhich is separable in X and Y. Since the L.H.S. of\n(2) is a function of x alone and R.H.S. of (2) is a func-\ntion of y alone, then (2) must be equal to a common\nconstant say k. Thus (2) reduces to\nf (X, X , X  , . . .) = k\n(3)\ng(X, X , X  , . . .) = k\n(4)\nThus the determination of solution to P.D.E.\nreduces to the determination of solutions to two\nO.D.E. (with appropriate conditions).\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\n1.

Assume that the rod has con-\nstant density \u03c1 and uniform cross section A. Also\nassume that the lateral surface of the rod is impen-\netrable to heat transfer i.e., rod is insulated laterally\nand therefore heat \ufb02ows only in the x-direction. The\nrod is suf\ufb01ciently thin so that the temperature is same\nat all points of any cross sectional area of the rod. Let\nu(x, t) be the temperature of the cross section at the\npoint x at any time t.\nFig. 19.1\nThe amount of heat Q(t) in a small segment of the\nrod between the cross sections at x and x +  x is\nQ(t) =\n x+ x\nx\n(c) (\u03c1A) u(s, t) ds\n(1)\nwhere c is speci\ufb01c heat of the rod. By Fourier law of\nheat conduction, rate of propagation of heat (i.e., the\nquantity of heat passing through a cross section at x\nin unit time) is\nq = \u2212k \u2202u\n\u2202x \u00b7 A\n(2)\nwhere k is the coef\ufb01cient of thermal conductivity.\nSince heat \ufb02ows in the direction of decreasing tem-\nperature, a negative sign appears in (2). The rate of\nheat \ufb02ow at cross section x +  x is\n\u2212kA \u2202u\n\u2202x (x +  x, t)\nThe rate of change of heat content in the segment\nof the rod between x and x +  x must be equal to\nnet heat \ufb02ow into this segment of the rod. Thus\n\u2202Q\n\u2202t = kA\n \u2202u\n\u2202x\n   \nx+ x \u2212\u2202u\n\u2202x\n   \nx\n \n(3)\nBy mean value theorem,\n\u2202Q\n\u2202t = \u2202\n\u2202t\n x+ x\nx\nc\u03c1Au(s, t) dt =\n x+ x\nx\nc\u03c1A\u2202u\n\u2202t ds\n= c\u03c1A \u00b7 ut(\u03be, t) x\n(4)\nwhere \u03be lies between x and x +  x. Replacing\nL.H.S. of (3) by (4)\nc\u03c1A \u2202u\n\u2202t (\u03be, t)  x = kA\n \u2202u\n\u2202x\n   \nx+ x \u2212\u2202u\n\u2202x\n   \nx\n \nRewriting this and taking the limit as  x \u21920,\n\u2202u(x, t)\n\u2202t\n= a2 \u22022u\n\u2202x2\n(5)\nwhere a2 =\nk\ncp known as diffusivity constant. Equa-\ntion (5) is the one-dimensional heat equation which\nis second order, homogeneous and parabolic type.\n19.4\nSOLUTION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL\nHEAT EQUATION\nBy separation of variables technique\nConsider a long thin wire or rod or bar of constant\ncross section and homogeneous heat conducting ma-\nterial. Let the bar be of length L oriented along\nthe x-axis with one end A coinciding with origin\n(Fig. 19.2). Suppose that the lateral surface of the\nbar is perfectly insulated. Then the heat \ufb02ows in the\nbar along the x-direction only.\nFig. 19.2\nThus the temperature u of the bar depends only\non x and t. This phenomenon is described by the\n\n19.4\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014V\ninitial boundary value problem consisting of one-\ndimensional heat equation\n\u2202u\n\u2202t = c2 \u22022u\n\u2202x2\n(1)\nwhere c2 is the thermal diffusivity, the boundary con-\nditions (B.C.\u2019s) prescribed at the end points A and B.\nx(0, t) = 0,\nx(L, t) = 0\n(2)\ni.e., the end points are assumed to be at zero temper-\nature and the initial temperature distribution in the\nbar given by\nu(x, 0) = f (x)\n(3)\nwhere f (x) is a given (prescribed) function of x.\nSolution by the separation of variables technique or\nthe method of separating variables or product method\nreduces the IBVP to the solution of two ordinary\ndifferential equations as follows:\nStep I. Assume that the solution u(x, t) is separa-\nble i.e.,\nu(x, t) = X(x)T (t)\n(4)\nwhere X(x) is a function of x alone and T (t) is a\nfunction of t only.\nDifferentiating (4) w.r.t. t and x, we get\n\u2202u\n\u2202t = XT. , ux = X T, uxx = X  T\nwhere  denotes differentiation w.r.t x and . denotes\ndifferentiationw.r.t.t.SubstitutingtheseintheP.D.E.\n(1), we get\nXT. = c2X  T\nX  \nX =\nT.\nc2T\n(5)\nSince the L.H.S. of (5) is a function of x alone\nwhile R.H.S. of (5) is a function of t alone, both\nsides of (5) must be a constant. Thus\nX  \nX =\nT.\nc2T = k = constant\nwhich results in two ordinary differential equations\nX  \u2212kX = 0\n(6)\nand\nT. \u2212c2kT = 0\n(7)\nUsing (4) the boundary conditions (2) reduce to\n0 = u(0, t) = X(0)T (t)\n=\u21d2X(0) = 0\n(8)\n0 = u(L, t) = X(L)T (t)\n=\u21d2X(L) = 0\n(9)\nsince T (t)  = 0 (otherwise if T (t) = 0, u = 0 for all\nt which is a trivial solution).\nStep II.\nCase 1:\nk = 0, X  = 0\nSolution is\nX(x) = ax + b\nusing (8) and (9)\n0 = X(0) = a \u00b7 0 + b\n... b = 0,\n0 = X(L) = a \u00b7 L\n... a = 0\nThus X(x) = 0 for all x or u = 0 for all x which\nis a trivial solution.\nCase 2:\nk = \u03bb2 > 0,\nX  \u2212\u03bb2X = 0\nSolution is\nX(x) = Ae\u03bbx + Be\u2212\u03bbx\nusing (8)\n0 = X(0) = A + B or A = \u2212B\nusing (9)\n0 = X(L) = A(e\u03bbL \u2212e\u2212\u03bbL)\n=\u21d2A = 0 = B\nsince\ne\u03bbL \u2212e\u2212\u03bbL = 2 sinh \u03bbL = 0\nonly when \u03bb = 0.\nThus X(x) = 0 for all x or u = 0 for all x which\nis a trivial solution.\nCase 3:\nk = \u2212\u03bb2\nEquation is\nX  + \u03bb2X = 0\nSolution is\nX(x) = A cos \u03bbx + B sin \u03bbX\nusing (8)\n0 = X(0) = A + B \u00b7 0 ... A = 0\nusing (9)\n0 = X(L) = B \u00b7 sin \u03bbL\nWe must take B  = 0 since otherwise X(x) = 0.\nHence\nsin \u03bbL = 0\nor\n\u03bbL = n\u03c0\n...\n\u03bb = n\u03c0\nL ,\nn integer\n(10)\nAssuming B = 1, we get in\ufb01nitely many solutions\nXn(x) = sin n\u03c0x\nL ,\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n(11)\nSolving (7)\nT. + e2\u03bb2T = 0, we get\nTn(t) = Bne\u2212\u03bb2nt = Bne\u2212n2\u03c02t/L2\n(12)\nHence the \u201ceigen functions\u201d\nun(x, t) = Xn(x)Tn(t)\n= Bn\nsin n\u03c0x\nL\n\u00b7 e\u2212\u03bb2nt, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . (13)\nsatisfy Equation (1) and boundary conditions (2).\nStep III. In order to satisfy the initial condition (3)\nwe invoke the superposition or linearity\nprinciple which states that\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\n19.5\nu(x, t) =\n\u221e\n \nn=1\nun(x, t)\n=\n\u221e\n \nn=1\nBn sin n\u03c0x\nL\n\u00b7 e\u2212c2n2\u03c02t/L2\n(14)\nsatis\ufb01es (1) and (2). To determine the unknown con-\nstants Bn, use initial condition (3) in (14)\nf (x) = u(x, 0) =\n\u221e\n \nn=1\nBn \u00b7 sin n\u03c0x\nL\n(15)\nSince the R.H.S. of (15) is a half range Fourier\nsine series expansion of f (x) in the interval (0, L),\nthe Fourier coef\ufb01cients Bn\u2019s are given by\nBn = 2\nL\n L\n0\nf (x) sin n\u03c0x\nL dx,\nn = 1, 2, . . .\n(16)\nThus the temperature distribution in the bar is\ngiven by the solution (14) with Bn\u2019s calculated from\n(16).\nNote:\nSolution (14) is transient contains (negative\nexponential) i.e., u decreases as t increases which is\nconsistent with physical nature of the heat conduc-\ntion problem.\nSteady-state condition\nA condition (phenomena) is said to be steady-state if\nthe (dependent) variables are independent (free) of\ntime t.\nNon-homogeneous boundary conditions are bound-\nary conditions which are all not zero.\nNon-homogeneous\n(Non-zero)\nBoundary\nConditions\nSuppose a bar AB of length L has its ends A\nand B maintained at A\u25e6\n0 and B\u25e6\n0 respectively until\nsteady-state condition is reached. Then the tempera-\ntures at A and B are suddenly and simultaneously\nchanged to A\u25e6\n1 and B\u25e6\n1 and maintained thereafter.\nTo \ufb01nd the subsequent temperature distribution in\nthe bar:\nStep I. Initial temperature distribution in the bar\nis determined using the steady-state con-\ndition in which u will be independent of t\n \ni.e., \u2202u\n\u2202t = 0\n \n. Therefore the heat equation\nreduces to\nd2u\ndx2 = 0\nIts solution is u(x) = ax + b\nThe boundary conditions in the steady-state are\nu(0) = A0 and u(L) = B0. Using these\nA0 = u(0) = a \u00b7 0 + b\n...\nb = A0\nB0 = u(L) = a \u00b7 L + A0\n...\na = (B0 \u2212A0)/L\nThus the initial temperature distribution in the\nbar is\nu(x, 0) = (B0 \u2212A0)\nL\nx + A0\n(17)\nNow the boundary conditions (temperatures) at A\nand B have been changed to\nu(0, t) = A1\nand\nu(L, t) = B1\n(18)\nThus the heat \ufb02ow problem is to solve the one-\ndimensional heat equation (1) with B.C.\u2019s (18) and\ninitial condition (17). Unlike the previous problem,\nhere the boundary conditions are non-homogeneous\n(non-zero). Therefore assume that the required solu-\ntion u(x, t) as\nu(x, t) = us(x) + utr(x, t)\n(19)\nwhere us(x) is the steady-state solution and utr(x, t)\nis the transient solution (containing negative expo-\nnential of time t).\nStep II.

Let \u03c1 be the constant\ndensity of the string (i.e., homogeneous string). Let\nthe function u(x, t) denote the displacement (or\nde\ufb02ection) of string at any point x and at any time\nt > 0 from the equilibrium position (x-axis). When\nthe string is distorted, then it vibrates. The small\ntransverse vibrations of such a vibrating string are\nmathematically modelled by one-dimensional wave\nequation.\nFig. 19.3\nAssume that the string is perfectly \ufb02exible and\noffers no resistance to bending. Applying Newton\u2019s\nsecond law of motion for a small portion of the string\nbetween x and x +  x, the equation is derived. Let\nT1 and T2 be tension at the end points P and Q of\nthis portion of the string.\nAssuming that points on the string move only in\nthe vertical direction, there is no motion in the hori-\nzontal direction. Thus the sum of the forces in the\nhorizontal direction must be zero i.e.,\n\u2212T1 cos \u03b1 + T2 cos \u03b2 = 0\nor\nT1 cos \u03b1 = T2 cos \u03b2 = T = constant\n(1)\nNeglectingthegravitationalforceonthestring,the\nonly two forces acting on the string are the vertical\ncomponents of tension \u2212T1 sin \u03b1 at P and T2 sin \u03b2\nat Q with upward direction takes as positive.

The\nsteady-state heat \ufb02ow in such a plate is obtained by\nsolving Laplace\u2019s equation in two-dimensions.\n\n19.18\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014V\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nSolve the Laplace\u2019s equation\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2 + \u22022u\n\u2202y2 = 0\n(1)\nin a rectangle in the xy-plane, 0 < x < a and\n0 < y < b (Fig. 19.5) satisfying the following\nboundary conditions\nFig. 19.5\nu(x, 0) = 0\n(on OA)\n(2)\nu(x, b) = 0\n(on BC)\n(3)\nu(0, y) = 0\n(on OB)\n(4)\nu(a, y) = f (y)\n(on AC)\n(5)\ni.e., u is zero on three sides OA, OB, BC and is\nprescribed by given function f (y) on the fourth side\nAC of the rectangle OACB.\nSolution:\nBy separation of variables:\nStep I.

The circular disk (Fig. 19.13) may\nbe considered as the limiting case of the region (Fig.\n19.12) as a \u21920 and \u03b1 \u21922\u03c0. So assume that u(r, \u03b8)\nis bounded as r \u21920. Using this in (10), as r \u21920, c2\nand c6 must be zero (because ln r \u2192\u221e, r\u2212p \u2192\u221e)\nas r \u21920. Thus\nu(r, \u03b8) = c9 + c10\u03b8 +\n+rp(c11 cos p\u03b8 + c12 sin p\u03b8)\n(17)\nwhere\nc9 = c1c3, c10 = c1c4, c11 = c5c7, c12 =\nc5c8. Note that the domain of \u03b8 is in\ufb01nite in\nthe present problem (\u2212\u221e< \u03b8 < \u221e) unlike the\nprevious problem where \u03b8 is \ufb01nite (0 < \u03b8 < \u03b1).\nSo\nwe\nassume\nthat\nu(r, \u03b8)\nis\nperiodic,\ni.e.,\nu(r, \u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = u(r, \u03b8) in order that u(r, \u03b8) is single-\nvalued function of \u03b8. In equation (17), since c10\u03b8\nis not periodic, we take c10 = 0. The constant c9 is\nanyway periodic. Finally in order that the remaining\ntwo terms cos p\u03b8 and sin p\u03b8 are periodic, we must\nhave\ncos p(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = cos p\u03b8\n(18)\nand\nsin p(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = sin p\u03b8\n(19)\nExpanding\nequation\n(18),\nwe\nhave\ncos p\u03b8 \u00b7\ncos 2\u03c0p \u2212sin p\u03b8 \u00b7 sin 2\u03c0p = cos p\u03b8.\nThen\ncos 2\u03c0p = 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, . . . and sin 2\u03c0p = 0\nfor k = 1\n2, 1, 3\n2, 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.

Thus a difference equation is an equa-\ntion relating various terms of a sequence a0, a1, a2,\n. . .. A string loaded with a \ufb01nite number of beads at\nequally spaced points leads to a difference equation.\nRecurrence relations obtained in the solution of DE\nby power series or Frobenius method are also differ-\nence equations. Numerical solution of DE also leads\nto difference equations.\nZ-transforms\nSolution of a discrete system, expressed as a differ-\nenceequationisobtainedusingz-transform.Discrete\nanalysis played important role in the development of\ncommunication engineering.\n21.1\nLINEAR DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS\nDifference equations are functional equations that\nde\ufb01ne sequences just as differential equations de\ufb01ne\nfunctions. They arise in several situations as follows.\nFinance: Compound Interest\nLet P0 be the amount of money deposited (invested)\nin a bank earning interest periodically say monthly or\nquarterly or annually. The conversion period r is the\ntime period between interest payment. Let Pn denote\nthe value of the deposit at the end of the nth conver-\nsion period, after n interest payments have accrued.\nThen in case of simple interest,\nPn+1 = Pn + rP0\nwhich is a \ufb01rst order difference equation\nPn+1 \u2212Pn = rP0\nwith solution Pn = P0(1 + nr)\nIn case of compound interest\nPn+1 = Pn + rPn\nwhich is a homogeneous difference equation\nPn+1 \u2212(1 + r)Pn = 0\nwith solution Pn = P0(1 + r)n. In this discrete pro-\ncess P is a function of an integer n rather than a\ncontinuous variable.\nFibonacci Relation:\nSuppose there is only one pair of rabbits male and\nfemale just born. Further suppose that every month\neach pair of rabbits that are one month old produce\na new pair of offspring of opposite sexes. Then Fn\nthe number of rabbits after n months is given by the\nrecurrence relation.\nFn = Fn\u22121 + Fn\u22122 for n \u22652\nwith the initial conditions F0 = F1 = 1. This gives\nrise to a second order homogeneous difference equa-\n21.1\n\n21.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014V\ntion\nFn \u2212Fn\u22121 + Fn\u22122 = 0\nBy repeated application of the recurrence relation\nthe equation can be solved recursively. Then we get\nF2 = 2, F3 = 3, F4 = 5, F5 = 8, F6 = 13, F7 = 21,\nF8 = 34 etc. The disadvantage here is that Fn is cal-\nculated upto certain value of n and these values are\nalso dependent on the initial conditions. Instead the\ngeneral solution\nFn = c1\n\u0001\n1 +\n\u221a\n5\n2\n\u0002n\n+ c2\n\u0001\n1 \u2212\n\u221a\n5\n2\n\u0002n\nis function of n and is independent of the initial con-\nditions.\nDifferential Equations\nIn the numerical solution of ordinary differential\nequations, the derivatives are discretized by replac-\ning them by the \ufb01nite (forward) differences. This\ngives rise to difference equations of the higher order.\nThus a continuous process described by a differential\nequation is approximated by a discrete process de-\nscribed by its counterpart a difference equation. (see\nChapter on Numerical Analysis 33). For example, in\na third order ordinary differential equation\na3y   + a2y  + a1y + a0y = F(x)\nthe derivatives can be replaced by y = yn+1 \u2212yn\nh\n,\ny  = yn+2 \u22122yn+1 + yn\nh2\ny   = yn+3 \u22123yn+2 + 3yn+1 \u2212yn\nh3\n, which results\nin a third order differences equation of the form\nb3yn+3 + b2yn+2 + b1yn+1 + b0yn = F(x)\nRecall that a sequence is a numerical valued function\nwhose domain of de\ufb01nition is the set of integers. It\nis denoted by {an} or an or a(n).\nA kth order linear difference equation in the se-\nquence yn is of the form\nakyn+k + ak\u22121yn+k\u22121 + . . . + a1yn+1+\n+ a0yn = f (n)\n(1)\nwhere n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . Thus (1) represents not\njust a single equation but an in\ufb01nite system of equa-\ntions one equation for every n. Here the coef\ufb01cients\na0, a1, . . . , ak are all constants and do not depend on\nn.Heref (n)dependsonlyonn.Whenak ischosenas\none, (1) is said to be in the standard form. If fn  = 0\nfor all n, then (1) is said to be non-homogeneous.\nOtherwise it is said to be homogeneous if fn = 0 for\nall n. The order of the difference equation (1) is the\npositive integer k which is the greatest difference in\nthe index of non-zero values of y. Equation (1) is\nlinear because each term in (1) is of \ufb01rst degree (lin-\near) in yn. Thus (1) is a non-homogeneous kth order\nlinear difference equation with constant coef\ufb01cients.\nDifference equation is also referred to as recur-\nrence relation since it expresses yn+k in terms of\none or more of the previous terms (of the sequence)\nnamely yn+k\u22121, . . . , yn+1, yn. In this case (1) can\nbe written as yn+k = \u2212ak\u22121yn+k\u22121 . . . \u2212a1yn+1 \u2212\na0yn + f (n). The difference equation (1) models a\nphysical system. So fn is known as system input\n(system excitation or forcing sequence or driving se-\nquence) while yn is referred to as system output (sys-\ntem response). The structure of the system is de\ufb01ned\nbythevaluesofthecoef\ufb01cientsandorderoftheequa-\ntion. Thus any system output depends on the system\ninput and the structure of the system. The general\nsolution of (1) determines the output yn which de-\npends only on n (but no longer on the prior terms of\nthe sequence) and describes the complete sequence\nyn in the closed form. Thus any sequence yn that\nsatis\ufb01es the difference equation (1) is a solution of\n(1). The solution of (1) can be obtained by (a) classi-\ncal approach similar to those used for solving linear\nnon-homogeneous differential equations with con-\nstant coef\ufb01cients (b) Laplace transform method (c)\nz-transform method (d) recursive method (which is a\nnumerical solution yielding a \ufb01nite number of terms\nof the sequence and is disadvantageous because it is\nin\ufb02uenced by the change of initial conditions). Here\nwe consider only the classical approach since theory\nof difference equations is analogous to that of dif-\nferential equations (which is considered in chapter\n9).\nHomogeneous Equations\nFirst order homogeneous difference equa-\ntion\nConsider a \ufb01rst order linear homogeneous differ-\nence equation yn+1 \u2212byn = 0 for n \u22650 and b is a\n\nLINEAR DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS AND Z-TRANSFORMS\n21.3\nconstant. Assume the solution of the form yn = crn\nwhere c  = 0, r  = 0. Then yn+1 = crn+1. Substitut-\ning in the given difference equation, we have\ncrn+1 \u2212bcrn = crn(r \u2212b) = 0\n\u21d2r \u2212b = 0\nor b = r. Thus the general solution of the differ-\nence equation yn+1 \u2212byn = 0 is given by yn = cbn.\nIn addition, if a boundary condition y0 = d then\nd = y0 = cb0 ...c = d.Thentheparticularsolution\nis yn = dbn. The solution yn de\ufb01nes a discrete func-\ntion whose domain is the set N of all non-negative\nintegers.\nSecond-order linear homogeneous differ-\nence equation with constant coef\ufb01cients\nConsider a2yn+2 + a1yn+1 + a0yn = 0\n(2)\nAssume yn = crn (with c  = 0, r  = 0)\n(3)\nas a solution of (2). Then substituting (3) in (2), we\nget\na2crn+2 + a1crn+1 + a0crn = 0\nor\ncrn(a2r2 + a1r + a0) = 0\nThus (3) is solution of (2) if\na2r2 + a1r + a0 = 0\n(4)\nsince c  = 0 and r  = 0. The equation (4) which is\na quadratic in r is known as the characteristic or\nauxiliary equation of (2).

Substituting (3) in (1), we get\nSn+1 \u2212Sn = [A(n + 1)4 + B(n + 1)3 + C(n + 1)2\n+D(n + 1)] \u2212[An4 + Bn3 + Cn2 + Dn] = (n + 1)3\n(5)\nThe unknown coef\ufb01cients A, B, C, D will be deter-\nmined by equating the coef\ufb01cients of like powers of\nn on both sides of (5).\nA(n4+4n3+6n2+4n+1)+B(n3+3n2+3n+1)\n+C(n2 + 2n + 1) \u2212(An4 + Bn3 + Cn2 + Dn)\n= n3 + 3n2 + 3n + 1\nor (4A)n3 + (6A + 3B)n2 + (4A + 3B + 2C)n\n+(A + B + C + D) = n3 + 3n2 + 3n + 1\nThen 4A = 1, 6A + 3B = 3, 4A + 3B + 2C = 3,\nand A + B + C + D = 1\nSolving A = 1\n4, B = 1\n2, C = 1\n4, D = 0. Thus the par-\nticularintegralis 1\n4n4 + 1\n2n3 + 1\n4n2.Thenthegeneral\nsolution of the difference equation (1) is given by\nSn = C.F. + P.I. = c + 1\n4n4 + 1\n2n3 + 1\n4n2\n(6)\nFor n = 1, we know that S1 = 13 = 1. Using this in\n(6), we get\n1 = S1 = c + 1\n4 + 1\n2 + 1\n4\n... c = 0\nThus the formula expressing the sum of cubes of the\n\ufb01rst n natural numbers is\nSn =\nn\n\r\ni=1\ni3 = 0 + 1\n4n4 + 1\n2n3 + 1\n4n2\nSn = n2(n + 1)2\n4\nShort cut inverse operator methods\nPower function\nExample 2:\nSolve an+2 \u22126an+1 + 5an = 2n with\na0 = 0, a1 = 0.\nSolution:\nThe auxiliary equation is m2 \u22126m +\n5 = 0 with real distinct roots m1 = 1, m2 = 5.

Complex analysis or com-\nplex function theory is the study of complex analytic\nfunctions. It is an elegant and powerful method\nuseful in the study of heat \ufb02ow, \ufb02uid dynamics and\nelectrostatics. Two-dimensional potential problem\ncan be solved using analytic functions since the\nreal and imaginary part of an analytic function are\nsolutions of two-dimensional Laplace\u2019s equation.\n22.1\nCOMPLEX FUNCTION\nBasic De\ufb01nitions\nCircle\n|z \u2212z0| = \u03c1 represents a circle with centre at the\npoint z0 and of radius \u03c1.\nNeighbourhood\nNeighbourhood of a point z0 is the set of all points z\nfor which |z \u2212z0| < \u03b4 where \u03b4 is a positive constant\n(Fig. 22.1).\nFig. 22.1\nDeleted neighbourhood of z0 is 0 < |z \u2212z0| < \u03b4.\nAnnulus of z0 is : \u03c11 < |z \u2212z0| < \u03c12.\nInterior point z0 of a set S\nIf there exists some neighbourhood of z0 which con-\ntains only points of S.\nBoundary point z0 of S\nIf every neighbourhood of z0 contains both points in\nS and points not in S.\nConnected set\nIf any two points of the set S are joined by a polygonal\nline, all the points of which lie in S.\nDomain\nA set S is said to be a domain if every point of S is\nan interior point and connected.\nBoundary of a domain is the collection of all\nboundary points of S.\nRegion\nis a domain together with some of its boundary\npoints.\nClosed region\nis a region together with the boundary (all boundary\npoints included).\n22.1\n\n22.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VI\nBounded region\nis bounded if it can be enclosed in a circle of \ufb01nite\nradius.\nExamples:\n1. |z| \u22641 is closed bounded region.\n2.

Range\nof f is the totality (set of) all values of f (z) corre-\nsponding to z in S.\nSince w is complex, it is written as\nw = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\nHere u(x, y) and v(x, y), real valued functions of\nx and y, are known as the real and imaginary parts of\nthe functions w(orf (z)).\nExample:\nf (z) = 2z2 \u22123iz = 2(x + iy)2 \u22123i(x + iy)\n= 2(x2 \u2212y2) + 4ixy \u22123ix + 3y\nSo\nu(x, y) = 2x2 \u22122y2 + 3y,\nv = 4xy \u22123x\nMulti-valued function f is one in which for every z\nmore than one value of w is associated. We consider\nonly single-valued functions.\nPolynomial in z of degree n (zero or positive inte-\nger) is the function\nf (z) = Pn(z) = a0 + a1z + . . . + anzn\nwhere a0, a1, . . . , an are complex constants. Ratio-\nnal fractional function is the quotient of polynomials\nP(z)/Q(z) de\ufb01ned for all z except those for which\nQ(z) = 0.\nLimit:\nL is said to be the limit of f (z) as z ap-\nproaches z0 and is denoted by\nlim\nz \u2192z0 = f (z) = L\nif for every  > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\n|f (z) \u2212L| <  whenever |z \u2212z0| < \u03b4.\nHere z may approach z0 from any direction.\n22.2\nCONTINUITY\nA function f (z) is said to be continuous at a point z0\nif f (z0) exists, lim\nz\u2192z0f (z) exists and\nlim\nz\u2192z0 f (z) = f (z0)\ni.e., limiting value of f (z) as z approaches z0 coin-\ncides with the value f (z0).\nA function is said to be continuous in a domain if\nit is continuous at every point of the domain.\nA function which is not continuous at z0(f (z0)\ndoesnotexist,or lim\nz\u2192z0 f (z)doesnotexistor lim\nz\u2192z0 f (z)\n = f (z0)) is known as discontinuous at z0.\nResult 1:\nIf f (z) and g(z) are continuous func-\ntions in D, then their sum f + g, difference f \u2212g,\nproduct fg, quotient f/g are all continuous in D.\nContinuous function of a continuous function is\ncontinuous.\nResult 2:\nf = u + iv is continuous if both u and\nv are continuous.\n22.3\nDIFFERENTIABILITY\nA function f (z) is said to be differentiable at a point\nz0 if the limit\nf  (z0) = lim\n z\u21920\nf (z0 +  z) \u2212f (z0)\n z\n= lim\nz\u2192z0\nf (z) \u2212f (z0)\nz \u2212z0\n(with z = z0 +  z)\nexists. The limit f  (z0) is known as the derivative\nof f (z) at z0. The above limit should be the same\nalong any path from z to z0.

In\nthis chapter we consider Cauchy\u2019s integral theorem\nwhich is one of the fundamental theorems of com-\nplex function theory. It gives suf\ufb01cient conditions\nfor a line integral around a simple closed curve to\nbe zero. An important consequence of this theorem\nis the Cauchy\u2019s integral formula in which the value\nf (z0) of an analytic function at z0 is completely de-\ntermined by an integral of f (z) on any simple closed\ncurve enclosing z0. It is powerful tool in evaluating\ncertain integrals. The complex Taylor series is a di-\nrect generalization of the Taylor series of real func-\ntion. However Laurent series is different from any\nseries in real calculus and is useful in evaluation of\nboth real and complex integrals and in summation of\nseries.\n23.1\nLINE INTEGRAL IN COMPLEX PLANE\nIntroduction\nContinuous arc: The set of points (x, y) de\ufb01ned by\nx = \u03c6(t), y = \u03c8(t), with parameter t in the interval\n(a, b), de\ufb01ne a continuous arc provided \u03c6 and \u03c8 are\ncontinuous functions.\nSmooth arc If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are differentiable, arc is\nsaid to be smooth.\nSimple curve is a curve having no self intersec-\ntions i.e., no two distinct values of t correspond to\nthe same point (x, y).\nClosed curve is one in which end points coincide\ni.e., \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b) and \u03c8(a) = \u03c8(b).\nSimple closed curve is a curve having no self\nintersections and with coincident end points.\nContour is a continuous chain of a \ufb01nite number\nof smooth arcs.\nClosed contour is a piecewise smooth closed\ncurve without points of self intersection.\nExamples: Boundaries of circle, ellipse, rectan-\ngle, triangle.\nPositive sense\nof traversing a contour is the direction such that the\ninterior domain bounded by the given closed contour\nremains on the left of the direction of motion.\nLine Integral\nDe\ufb01nite integral or complex line integral or simply\nline integral of a complex function f (z) from z1 to\nz2 along a curve c is de\ufb01ned as\n \nc\nf (z)dz =\n \nc\n(u + iv)(dx + idy)\n=\n \nc\n(udx \u2212vdy) + i\n \nc\n(vdx + udy)\n=\n z2\nz1\n(ux. \u2212vy. )dt + i\n z2\nz1\n(vx. + uy. )dt\nwhere dot (\u00b7) denotes differentiation w.r.t. \u2018t\u2019.\nHere c is known as the path of integration.

When (1) is cleared of fractions, it takes\nthe form\nAzw + Bz + Cw + D = 0\nwhich is linear in z, linear in w or bilinear in z and w.\nBilinear transformation (B.T.) (1) is also known as\nlinear fractional transformation or M\u00a8obius transfor-\nmation.\nDifferentiating (1) w.r.t. z, we get\ndw\ndz = ad \u2212bc\n(cz + d)2\n(2)\nIf ad \u2212bc  = 0, then dw\ndz  = 0 for any z and therefore\nBilinear transformation is conformal for all z i.e., it\nmaps z-plane conformally onto the w-plane.\nIf ad \u2212bc = 0, then dw\ndz = 0 for any z. Then every\npoint of z-plane is critical and the function is not\nconformal.\nFor a choice of the constants a, b, c, d, we get\nspecial cases of Bilinear transformation as\nw = z + b\nTranslation\nw = az\nRotation\nw = az + b\nLinear transformation\nw = 1\nz\nInversion in the unit circle\nThus B.T. can be considered as combination of these\ntransformations.\nSolving (1) for z, we \ufb01nd that inverse of the\nBilinear transformation is\nz = dw \u2212b\n\u2212cw + a\n(3)\nwhich is again a Bilinear transformation.\nFrom (1), observe that the point z = \u2212d\nc corre-\nsponds to w = \u221e, point at in\ufb01nity in the w-plane.\nSimilarly from (3), the point w = a\nc corresponds to\nz = \u221e, point at in\ufb01nity in the z-plane.\nFixed (or Invariant) Points\nFixed (or invariant) points of function w = f (z)\nare points which are mapped onto themselves.\ni.e., w = f (z) = z.\nExample:\nw = z\nhas every point a \ufb01xed point,\nw = z,\nin\ufb01nitely many\nw = 1\nz\nhas two\nw = z + b\nhas no \ufb01xed point.\nTo obtain the \ufb01xed points of (1), solve\nz = az + b\ncz + d\nwhich is a quadratic in z given by\ncz2 \u2212(a \u2212d)z \u2212b = 0\n(4)\nThus the roots say \u03b1, \u03b2 of (4) are the \ufb01xed points of\n(1).

All these\ntransformations preserve circles. Thus the bilinear\ntransformation can be considered as combination of\ntranslation, rotation, stretching and inversion passing\nfrom z-plane to w1-plane to w2-plane to w3-plane\nto w-plane. Hence under B.T. circles transform into\ncircles.\nThe cross-ratio or anharmonic ratio of four num-\nbers z1, z2, z3, z4 is the linear fraction given by\n(z1 \u2212z2)(z3 \u2212z4)\n(z1 \u2212z4)(z3 \u2212z2).\nTheorem 2:\nThe cross-ratio of four points is in-\nvariant under a bilinear transformation.\nProof:\nSuppose w1, w2, w3, w4 are respectively\nthe images of z1, z2, z3, z4 under the bilinear trans-\nformation\nw = az + b\ncz + d\nThen\nwi \u2212wj = azi + b\nczi + d \u2212azj + b\nczj + d\nwi \u2212wj = (ad \u2212bc)(zi \u2212zj)\n(czi + d)(czj + d)\n(6)\nNow consider the cross-ratio of w1, w2, w3, w4, and\nuse (6).

Although four\nconstants a, b, c, d appear in (1), essentially they are\nthree ratios of three of these constants to the fourth\none.\nTo \ufb01nd the unique bilinear transformation which\nmaps three given distinct points z1, z2, z3 onto three\ndistinct images w1, w2, w3, consider w which is the\nimage of a general point z under this transforma-\ntion. Now by Theorem 2, the cross-ratio of the four\npoints w1, w2, w3, w must be equal to the cross-ratio\nof z1, z2, z3, z.

The main dif\ufb01culty in this transformation\nis the complexity of the Schwarz-Christoffel integral.\nLet P denote a bounded (closed) polygon in\nthe w-plane with n vertices at the points A1, A2,\n. . . , An. Let \u03b11\u03c0, \u03b12\u03c0, . . . , \u03b1n\u03c0 be the inte-\nrior angles at these vertices respectively. Here \u03b11,\n\u03b12, . . . , \u03b1n are positive constants. For a closed\npolygon, the sum of the interior angles is (n \u2212\n2)\u03c0.

Thus\nthe size of the angle through which tangent to S at\nw0 to be rotated is determined by arg f  (z0).\nw-plane\nz-plane\na\nzo\nC\nb\nwo\nS\nFig. 25.42\n(i.e.,) \u03b2 = \u03b1 + arg f  (z0). If c is straight line along\nx-axis, then \u03b1 = 0 and if f  (z0) = constant, then S is\nalso a straight line in w-plane.\nNow from (2) arg dw = arg c + (\u03b11 \u22121) arg(z \u2212\na1) + (\u03b12 \u22121) arg(z \u2212a2) + . . . + (\u03b1n \u22121) arg(z \u2212\nan) + arg dz\n(3)\nTo determine the size of the angles between adja-\ncent segments say Ai\u22121Ai and AiAi+1 of the polyg-\nonal line, consider the variation of the argument of\nf  (z).\nFor z = x < a1, the numbers (z \u2212a1), (z \u2212a2),\n. . ., (z \u2212an) are all negative real numbers and hence\nhave \u03c0 astheirarguments. Generalizingthis, wehave\narg(z \u2212ai) =\n\u0012\u03c0 if z < ai\n0 if z > ai\nNote that dz is positive and its argument is zero. Thus\nwhen z < a1, all the terms in (3) are constants and\ntherefore arg dw remains constant. Thus the image\npoint w traces a straight line in the w-plane.\nNow as soon as z passes through a1, a1 becomes\nless than z, so (z \u2212a1) changes abruptly from neg-\native to positive and therefore arg (z \u2212a1) changes\nabruptly from \u03c0 to 0. Thus straight line AnA1 bends\nthrough an angle \u03c0 \u2212\u03b11\u03c0 since argument of dw\nchanges by \u03c0 \u2212\u03b11\u03c0. Thus the interior angle at A1 of\nthe polygon P is \u03b11\u03c0. Now for a1 < z < a2, arg dw\nremains constant, but when z passes through a2, then\na2 < z so (z \u2212a2) is positive with argument zero.\nThen arg dw changes by \u03c0 \u2212\u03b12\u03c0 and so on. Thus\nwhen the point z traverses the entire real axis in the\npositive direction, its image w makes a complete cir-\ncuit of the boundary of a closed polygon with interior\nangles \u03b11\u03c0, \u03b12\u03c0, . . . \u03b1n\u03c0. Hence (1) maps the real\naxis of the z-plane onto some closed polygon line\nA1A2 . . . An whose sides are the straight line seg-\nments AkAk+1. Since w is analytic, (1) is conformal.\nThus the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation which\nmaps the upper half plane in z-axis onto the interior\nof a closed polygon in the w-plane is\nw = f (z) = c\n\u0013 z\n0\n(t \u2212a1)\u03b11\u22121(t \u2212a2)\u03b12\u22121 \u00d7\n. . . \u00d7 (t \u2212an)\u03b1n\u22121dt + c\n(5)\nHere t is a dummy variable.

Thus there is an interior\npoint z0 of c such that f (z0) = b.

The theory of probability is the study of\nsuch random phenomena which are not determinis-\ntic. In analyzing and interpreting data that involves\nan element of \u201cchance\u201d or uncertainty, probability\ntheory plays a vital role in the theory and applica-\ntion of statistics. Blaise Pascal in the middle of 17th\ncentury was the \ufb01rst to use probability in problems\nof gambling. Laplace, De Moivre, Gauss, Poisson\nand Kolmogorov greatly contributed to the develop-\nment of probability theory which \ufb01nds application in\nengineering, biology, economics, computer science,\npolitics, traf\ufb01c control, medicine, meteorology, psy-\nchology, agriculture, geography and management of\nnatural resources. We consider the Baye\u2019s theorem\n(also known as theorem of inverse probability) which\ndetermines the probability of \u201ccauses.\u201d\n26.1\nREVIEW OF SET THEORY\nSet\nA Set is well-de\ufb01ned collection of objects. Sets are\ndenoted by capital letters A, B, C, . . . and the objects\nalso known as elements or members of the set by\nsmall letters x, y, . . .. If x is a member or element of\nA, it is denoted by x \u2208A. If y is not an element of\nB, then y /\u2208B.\nExample 1:\nV = set of all vowels in English alpha-\nbet = {a, e, i, o, u}\n2. N = set of natural numbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}\n3. E = set of even numbers = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, . . .} =\n{2n|n \u2208N}\nNull set\nA Null set or empty set is the unique set containing\nno elements. It is denoted by \u03c6 or {}.\nExample 1:\nThe set of women presidents of India\nis an empty set.\n2. {n \u2208N : 3 < n < 4} is an empty set\n3. {x \u2208Real : x2 + 3 = 0} is an empty set.\nEquality\nTwo sets are said to be equal if they contain the same\nelements.\nNote:\nThe order of listing is irrelevant. There is\nno advantage (or harm) in listing the elements more\nthan once.\nExample:\nSets A = {1, 3, 5, 6}, B = {6, 5, 3, 1},\nand C = {3, 5, 3, 6, 1, 6, 1, 5, 5} are all equal. Nei-\nther order nor repetition is relevant.\nFinite and In\ufb01nite Sets\nIf the number of elements in a set A is \ufb01nite, then the\nset is said to be a \ufb01nite set. The number of distinct\n26.1\n\n26.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nelements in a \ufb01nite set A is known as the cardinality\nor size of A and is denoted by |A|.\nExample:\n|Set of vowels| = 5,\nEx : |\u03c6| = 0,\nEx : |A| = |B| = |C| = 4,\nEx : D = {x2|x \u2208N,\nx2 < 30} = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}, then |D| = 5 when the\nnumber of elements is in\ufb01nite, the set is said to be\nan in\ufb01nite set.\nExample:\nSet of natural numbers, set of real num-\nbers are in\ufb01nite sets.\nUniversal Set\nUniversal Set denoted by U is set containing all ob-\njects under study (or consideration).\nSubset\nA is a subset of B and is written as A \u2286B if every\nelement of A as an element of B.\nExample:\n\u03c6 is subset of any set A, i.e., \u03c6 \u2286A.\nExample:\nSet of even numbers is a subset of set of\nintegers.\nExample:\nA is subset of itself: A \u2286A.\nProper Subset\nIf B contains elements not in A, then the subset A is\nsaid to be proper subset of B, denoted by A \u2282B.\nExample:\nA = {4, 5, 6, }, B = {6, 7},\nC = {4, 5, 6, 7} then\n(a) A \u2286C\n(b) A \u2282C\n(c) B \u2286C\n(d) B \u2282C\n(e) B  \u2286A\n(f) A \u2286A (g) A  \u2282A (i.e., A is not a\nproper subset of A itself)\n(h) \u03c6 \u2282A\n(i) \u03c6 \u2282B\n(k) \u03c6 \u2282C\nNote:\nOnly a set can be a subset of another set,\nwhile only elements can be members of a set.\nPower Set\nPower Set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set (collec-\ntion) of all subsets of A.\nExample:\nA = {4, 5, 6, 7} then the power set of A\nis P (A) = {\u03c6, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}, {4, 7},\n{5, 6}, {5, 7}, {6, 7}, {4, 5, 6}, {4, 5, 7}, {4, 6, 7},\n{5, 6, 7}, {4, 5, 6, 7}}.\nResult 1:\nIf |A| = n, then the power set of a set\nA with n elements has 2n elements i.e., |P(A)| =\n2|A| = 2n\nExample:\n|A| = 4, P(A) = 24 = 16\nP (\u03c6) = {\u03c6}\nP({\u03c6}) = {\u03c6, {\u03c6}}\nResult 2:\nFor any 0 \u2264k \u2264n, there are nck subsets\nof size k.\nExample:\nA = {4, 5, 6, 7}, |A| = n = 4, let k =\n2.

A probability\nmodel can be developed, for a given idealized con-\nditions in a game of chance by incorporating all the\nfactors that have a bearing on this game. In building\nsuch model, the empirical data of frequency distribu-\ntion, A.M., variance etc. are to be taken into account.\nIn the discrete case we consider discrete uniform dis-\ntribution, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Poisson distri-\nbutions. The continuous probability distributions we\nstudy are uniform distribution, normal distribution,\nexponential, gamma, Weibull distributions which are\nof great practical importance.\nRecall that in a random experiment, the outcomes\n(or results) are governed by chance mechanism and\nthe sample space S of such a random experiment\nconsists of all outcomes of the experiment. When\nthe elements (outcomes/events) of the sample space\nare non-numeric, they can be quanti\ufb01ed by assigning\na real number to every event of the sample space.\nThis assignment rule, known as the random variable\n(R.V.), provides the power of abstraction and thus\ndiscards unimportant \ufb01nest-grain description of the\nsample space.\nA random variable X on a sample space S is a\nfunction X: S \u2192R from S to the set of real numbers\nR, which assigns a real number X(s) to each sample\npoint s of S (refer Fig. 27.1).\nFig. 27.1\nRange space RX: is the set of all possible values of\nX is a subset of real numbers R.\nAlthough X is called a random \u201cvariable\u201d note that\nit is infact a \u201csingle-valued function\u201d.\nNotation:\nIf R.V. is denoted by X, then x (corre-\nsponding small letter) denotes one of its values.\nDiscrete\nA R.V. X is said to be discrete R.V. if its set of possi-\nble outcomes, the sample space S, is countable (\ufb01nite\nor an unending sequence with as many elements as\nthere are whole numbers).\nContinuous\nA R.V. X is said to be continuous R.V. if S contains\nin\ufb01nite numbers equal to the number of points on a\nline segment.\n27.1\nPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nDiscrete Probability Distributions\nEach event in a sample space has certain probability\n(or chance) of occurrence (or happening). A formula\n27.1\n\n27.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nrepresenting all these probabilities which a discrete\nR.V. assumes, is known as the discrete probability\ndistribution.\nExample:\nLet X denote the discrete R.V. which\ndenotes the minimum of the two numbers that appear\nin a single throw of a pair of fair dice. Then X is a\nfunction from the sample space S consisting of 36\nordered pairs {(1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (6, 6)} to a subset\nof real numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nThe event minimum 5 can appear in the following\ncases (occurrences) (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5). Thus R.V.\nX assigns to this event of the sample space a real\nnumber 3. The probability of such an event happen-\ning is 3\n36 since there are 36 exhaustive cases. This is\nrepresented as\nP(X = xi) = pi = f (xi) = P(X = 5) = f (5) = 3\n36.\nCalculating in a similar way the other probabilities,\nthe distribution of probabilities of this discrete R.V.\nis denoted by the discrete probability distribution as\nfollows:\nX = xi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nP(X = xi)\n= f (xi)\n= pi\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n11\n36\n9\n36\n7\n36\n5\n36\n3\n36\n1\n36\nDiscrete probability distribution, probability func-\ntion or probability mass function of a discrete R.V.\nX is the function f (x) satisfying the following con-\nditions:\ni. f (x) \u22650\nii.\n \nx\nf (x) = 1\niii. P (X = x) = f (x).\nThus probability distribution is the set of ordered\npairs (x, f (x)), i.e., outcome x and its probability\n(chance) f (x).\nCumulative distribution or simply distribution of a\ndiscrete R.V. X is F(x) de\ufb01ned by\nF(x) = P(X \u2264x) =\n \nt\u2264x\nf (t)\nfor \u2212\u221e< x < \u221e.\nIt follows that\nF(\u2212\u221e) = 0,\nF(+\u221e) = 1,\np(xj) = P (X = xj) = F(xj) \u2212F(xj\u22121).\nContinuous Probability Distributions\nFor a continuous R.V. X, the function f (x) sat-\nisfying the following, is known as the probability\ndensity function (P.D.F.) or simply density function\n(Fig. 27.2).\nFig. 27.2\ni. f (x) \u22650\nii.\n \u221e\n\u2212\u221ef (x)dx = 1\niii.

X, with P.D.F. f (x), the cu-\nmulative distribution F(x) is de\ufb01ned as\nF(x) = P (X \u2264x) =\n x\n\u2212\u221e\nf (t)dt, \u2212\u221e< x < \u221e\nIt follows that\nF(\u2212\u221e) = 0,\nF(+\u221e) = 1,\n0 \u2264F(x) \u22641\nfor \u2212\u221e< x < \u221e.\nf (x) = dF(x)\ndx\n= F  (x) \u22650 and\nP (a < X < b) = F(b) \u2212F(a).\n\nPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\n27.3\nExpectation\nThe behaviour of a R.V. (either discrete or contin-\nuous) is completely characterized by the distribu-\ntion function F(x) or density f (x) [P(xi) in discrete\ncase]. Instead of a function, a more compact descrip-\ntion can be made by a single numbers such as mean\n(expectation), median and mode known as measures\nof central tendency of the R.V. X.\nExpectation or mean or expected value\nExpectation or mean or expected value of a random\nvariable X, denoted by E(X) or \u00b5, is de\ufb01ned as\nE(X) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n \ni\nxif (xi),\nifX is discrete\n \u221e\n\u2212\u221exf (x)dx,\nif X is continuous\nNote 1:\nx is median if P(X < x) \u22641\n2 and\nP (X > x) \u22641\n2.\nNote 2:\nx is mode for which f (x) or P(xi) attains\nits maximum.\nVariance\nVariance characterizes the variability in the distribu-\ntions, since two distributions with same mean can\nstill have different dispersion of data about their\nmeans.\nVariance of R.V.

The\nBernoulli process has the following properties:\ni. An experiment is repeated n number of times,\ncalled n trials where n is a \ufb01xed integer.\nii. The outcome of each trial is classi\ufb01ed into two\nmutually exclusive (dichotomus) categories ar-\nbitrarily called a \u201csuccess\u201d and a \u201cfailure\u201d.\niii. Probability of success, denoted by p, remains\nconstant for all trials.\niv. The outcomes are independent (of the outcomes\nof the previous trials).\nEach trial in the Bernoulli process is known as\nBernoulli trial.\nThe binomial random variable X is the number of\nsuccesses in n Bernoulli trials. X is discrete since X\ntakes only integer values (we \u2018count\u2019 the number of\nsuccesses).\nBinomial distribution is thus the probability dis-\ntribution of this discrete random variable X, and is\ngiven by\nb(x; n, p) =\n n\nx\n \npxqn\u2212x, x = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n\n(1)\nwherenisthenumberoftrialsandp istheprobability\nof success in any trial. The probability of x successes\nis px and remaining failures is qn\u2212x. This can happen\nin nCx ways. By multiplication rule, the probability\nof x successes in n trials is\n n\nx\n \npxqn\u2212x.\nNote that the (n + 1) terms of the binomial expansion\n(q + p)n =\n n\n0\n \nqn +\n n\n1\n \npqn\u22121 +\n n\n2\n \np2qn\u22122\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\n n\nn\n \npn\n= b(0; n, p) + b(1; n, p) + b(2; n, p)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b(n; n, p)\n=\nn\n \nx=0\nb(x; n, p)\ncorrespond to various values of b(x; n, p) for x =\n0, 1, 2, . . . , n.\nSince p + q = 1, it follows that\nn\n \nx=0\nb(x; n, p) = 1.\nB.D. is characterized by the parameter p and the\nnumber of trials n.\nThe mean \u00b5 of B.D. is np and the variance \u03c3 2 of\nB.D. is npq.

A statistic is a random variable since its\nvalue depends on observed sample values which will\ndiffer from sample to sample. Whereas its particular\nvalue depends on a given set of sample values . Thus\ndetermination of sampling distribution of a statistic\nis essentially a mathematical problem.\nSuppose we wish to compare the mean I.Q of stu-\ndents of one university with another university or to\ncompare proportion of alcoholics among men with\nthat among women or compare the variances of life-\ntimes of T.V. produced by one company with the\nvariance of another company. In such statistical in-\nvestigation of the study of two (or more) populations\nwe compare their respective parameters.\nThe nearness of two quantities can be measured\nas follows. If the difference of the two quantities is\nclose to zero, then the two quantities are very close\nto each other. Alternatively when the ratio of the two\nquantities is nearly equal to zero, then the two quan-\ntities are near to each other, otherwise they are far\napart. By taking two random samples one from each\npopulation, we compare the corresponding sample\nanalogues.\nStatistical methods are used to study a process by\nanalyzing the data, discrete or continuous, recorded\nas either numerical value or a descriptive represen-\ntation to improve the \u201cquality\u201d of the process. Thus\nstatistician is mainly concerned with the analysis of\ndata about the characteristics of persons or objects\nor observations.\n28.1\nPOPULATION AND SAMPLE\nPopulation is the set or collection or totality of ob-\njects, animate or inanimate, actual or hypothetical,\nunder study. Thus mainly population consists of sets\nof numbers, measurements or observations which are\nof interest.\nSize\nSize of the population N is the number of objects or\nobservations in the population.\nPopulation is said to be \ufb01nite or in\ufb01nite depending\non the size N being \ufb01nite or in\ufb01nite.\nSince it is impracticable or uneconomical or time\nconsuming to study the entire population, a \ufb01nite\nsubset of the population known as sample is studied.\nSize of the sample is denoted by n. Sampling is the\nprocess of drawing samples from a given population.\nExamples:\n(i) Population of India, Population of\nA.P. Estate (sample) (ii) Engineering colleges recog-\nnised by AICTE, Engineering colleges af\ufb01liated to\nJNTU (sample) (iii) Cars produced in India, Matiz\ncars (sample) (iv) Healthcare expenditure by Central\nGovt., Expenditure of A.P. Govt. (sample), Expendi-\nture by district (sub sample), Expenditure in a district\nhospital (sub-sample) etc. (v) Number of software\nspecialists by 2020.\nLarge sampling\nIf n \u226530, the sampling is said to be large sampling.\n28.1\n\n28.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nSmall sampling\nIf n < 30, the sampling is said to be small sam-\npling or exact sampling.\nStatistical Inference\nStatistical inference or inductive statistics deals with\nthe methods of drawing (arriving at) valid or logical\ngeneralizations and predictions about the population\nusing the information contained in the sample alone,\nwith an indication of the accuracy of such inferences.\nParameters\nStatistical measures or constants obtained from the\npopulation are known as population parameters or\nsimply parameters.\nExample:\nPopulation mean, population variance.\nSimilarly, statistical quantities computed from sam-\nple observations are known as sample statistics or\nbrie\ufb02y \u201cstatistics\u201d.\nThus parameters refer to population while statis-\ntics refer to sample.\nExamples: sample mean, sample variance etc.\nNotation\n\u00b5, \u03c3, p represent the population mean, population\nstandard deviation, population proportion. Similarly,\nX, s, P denote sample mean, sample s.d., sample\nproportion.\nPopulation f(x)\nPopulation f (x) is a population whose probability\ndistribution is f (x).\nExample:\nIf f (x) is binomial, Poisson or normal,\nthen the corresponding population is known as\nbinomial population, Poisson population or normal\npopulation.\nSince the samples must be representative of the\npopulation, sampling should be random.\nRandom sampling\nis one in which each member\nof the population has equal chances or probability of\nbeing included in the sample.\nIn sampling with replacement,\neach member\nof the population may be chosen more than once,\nsince the member is replaced in the population.\nThus sampling from \ufb01nite population with\nreplacement can be considered theoretically as sam-\npling from in\ufb01nite population. Whereas, in sampling\nwithout replacement, an element of the popula-\ntion can not be chosen more than once, as it is not\nreplaced.\nStatistic\nStatistic is a real valued function of the random sam-\nple. So statistic is a function of one or more ran-\ndom variables not involving any unknown parame-\nter. Thus statistic is a function of samples observa-\ntions only and is itself a random variable. Therefore\na statistic must have a probability distribution.\nSample mean and sample variance are two impor-\ntantstatistics whicharemeasuresofarandomsample\nX1, X2, . . . Xn of size n.\nSample mean = X =\nn\u0001\ni=1\nXi\nn\n(measure of central tendency)\nSample Variance\n= S2 =\nn\u0001\ni=1\n(Xi \u2212X2)\nn \u22121\n= n \u0001 X2\ni \u2212(\u0001 Xi)2\nn(n \u22121)\n(measure of variability of data about the mean).\nSample standard deviation is the positive square\nroot of the sample variance.\nDegrees of Freedom (dof) of a statistic is a positive\ninteger, denoted by \u03bd, equals to n \u2212k where n is the\nnumber of independent observations of the random\nsample and k is the number of population parameters\nwhich are calculated using the sample data. Thus dof\n\u03bd = n \u2212k isthedifferencebetweennthesamplesize\nandk thenumberofindependentconstraintsimposed\non the observations in the sample.\n28.2\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\nDraw all possible samples of size n, from a given\n\ufb01nite population of size N. Then the total number\nof all possible samples each of the same size n,\nwhich can be drawn from the population is given\nby NCn =\nN!\nn!(N\u2212n)! = k. Compute a statistic S (such\nas the mean, s.d., median, mode etc.) for each of\nthese sample using the sample data x1, x2, . . . , xn by\nS = S(x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn)\n\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\n28.3\nSample number\n1\n2\n3\n. . .\nk\nStatistic S\nS1\nS2\nS3\n. . .\nSk\nSampling distribution (S.D.) of the statistic is\nthe set of values {S1, S2, . . . , Sk} of the statistic S\nobtained one for each sample. Thus sampling distri-\nbution describes how a statistic S will vary from one\nsample to the other of the same size. Although all the\nk samples are drawn from the given population, the\nmembers included in different samples are different.\nThe difference in the value of the statistics, attributed\nto chance, is known as sampling \ufb02uctuations.\nWhen the number of samples (each of the same\nsize n) is in\ufb01nitely large (i.e., sampling without\nreplacement) then the probability distribution of the\nstatistic is the sampling distribution of the statistic.\nIf the statistic S is mean, then the corresponding\ndistribution of the statistics is known as sampling dis-\ntribution of means. Thus if S is variance, proportion\nor medians etc., the associated distribution is known\nas sampling distribution of variances, sampling dis-\ntribution of proportions etc. Now for each of these\nsampling distributions, the statistics mean, variance\netc., can be computed as follows:\nMean of the sampling distribution of S = S =\n1\nk\nk\u0001\ni=1\nSi variance of S = 1\nk\nk\u0001\ni=1\n(Si \u2212S)2\nThus we can have mean of the sampling distribu-\ntion of means, variance of the sampling distribution\nof means, variance of the sampling distribution of\nvariances etc.\nStandard Error (S.E.)\nStandard Error (S.E.) is the standard deviation of the\nsampling distribution of a statistic S. It gives an index\nof the precision of the estimate of the parameters. As\nthe sample size n increases, S.E. decreases. Standard\nerror plays an important role in large sample theory\nand forms the basis in tests of hypothesis.\nSampling distribution of statistics helps to learn\ninformation about the corresponding population\nparameters.\n28.3\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF\nMEANS: (\u03c3 KNOWN)\nSampling distribution of means (S.D.M.)

When \u03c3 is unknown, for large\nn(\u226530), \u03c3 can be replaced by the sample standard\ndeviation s, calculated using the sample mean x by\nthe formula s2 =\nn\u0001\ni=1\n(xi\u2212x)2\nn\u22121 . For small sample of size\nn(< 30), the unknown \u03c3 can be substituted by s,\nprovided we make an assumption that the sample\nis drawn from a normal population.\nResult:\nLet x be the mean of a random sample of\nsize n drawn from a normal population with mean \u00b5\nand variance \u03c3 2 then\nt = x \u2212\u00b5\ns/\u221an\nis a random variable having the t-distribution with\n\u03bd = n \u22121 degrees of freedom with probability den-\nsity function.\nf (t) =\n1\n\u03b2\n\f\n1\n2, \u03bd\n2\n\r 1\n\u221a\u03bd\n1\n\f\n1 + t2\n\u03bd\n\r(\u03bd+1)/2 , \u2212\u221e< t < \u221e\nW.S. Gosset\u2217\ufb01rst published in 1908, the proba-\nbility distribution of t under the pseudonym \u201cstu-\ndent\u201d. So the t-distribution is also known as \u201cstudent\nt-distribution\u201d. 1925, R.A. Fisher used t-distribution\nto test the regression coef\ufb01cient.\n\u2217William Sealy Gosset (1876\u20131937) English statistician.\nHere sample variance s is given by\ns2 =\n1\nn \u22121\nn\n\u000e\ni=1\n(xi \u2212x)2.\nThus for small samples (n < 30) and with\n\u03c3 unknown, a natural statistic for infernce on popu-\nlation mean \u00b5 is\nt = x \u2212\u00b5\ns/\u221an\nwith the underlying assumption of sampling from\nnormal population. So the above result is more\ngeneral than the central limit theorem since \u03c3 is\nnot needed and less general than the central limit\ntheorem since population is assumed to be normal.\nFig. 28.8\nThe t-distribution curve is symmetric about the\nmean 0, unimodal, bell shaped and asymptotic on\nboth sides of t-axis. Thus the t-distribution curve\nis similar to normal curve. While the variance for\nnormal distribution is 1, the variance for the t-\ndistribution is more than one since it depends on the\nparameter \u03bd. So the t-distribution is more variable.\nAs n \u2192\u221e, variance of t-distribution approaches 1.\nThus\nas\n\u03bd = (n \u22121) \u2192\u221e,\nt-distribution\napproaches the standard normal distribution. Infact\nfor n \u226530, standard normal distribution provides a\ngood approximation to the t-distribution.\nCritical values of t-distribution (see A13 to A14)\nis denoted by t\u03b1 which is such that the area under\nthe curve to the right of t\u03b1 equals to \u03b1. Since the\nt-distribution is symmetric, it follows that\nt1\u2212\u03b1 = \u2212t\u03b1\ni.e., the t-value leaving an area of 1 \u2212\u03b1 to the right\nand therefore an area \u03b1 to its left, is equal to the\nnegative t-value which leaves an area \u03b1 in the right\n\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\n28.13\ntail of the distribution.\nFig. 28.9\nSymmetry property of t-distribution.\nThe critical values t\u03b1 are tabulated in tables (A13\nto A14) for various values of the parameter \u03bd.

It is a continu-\nous probability distribution of a continuous random\nvariable X, with density function given by\nf (x) =\n1\n2\u03bd/2!(\u03bd/2)x\n\u03bd\n2 \u22121e\u2212x/2\nfor\nx > 0\nwhich is a special case of gamma distribution with\n\u03b1 = \u03bd/2 and \u03b2 = 2. Here \u03bd is a positive integer is\nthe only single parameter of the distribution. \u03bd is\nknown as \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d (dof). Chi-squared\ndistribution is extensively used in sampling distri-\nbutions, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non-\nparametric tests. It was \ufb01rst discovered by Helmert\nin 1876 and later independently by Karl Pearson in\n1900.\nIt was mainly used as a measure of goodness of\n\ufb01t and to test the independence of attributes. Chi-\nsquared distribution is denoted as \u03c7 2-distribution.\nProperties of \u03c7 2-distribution\n1. \u03c72-distribution curve is not a normal curve and\nlies completely in the \ufb01rst quadrant since \u03c72\nvaries from 0 to \u221e. i.e., \u03c72-distribution is not\nsymmetrical.\n2. It depends only on \u03bd, the dof.\n3. It is unimodal curve with mode at \u03c72 = (k \u22121).\n4. It is additive i.e., if \u03c72\n1 and \u03c72\n2 are two independent\ndistributions with \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 dof then \u03c72\n1 + \u03c72\n2 will\nbe chi-squared distribution with (\u03bd1 + \u03bd2) dof.\nHere\u03b1 denotestheareaunderthechi-squaredistri-\nbution to the right of \u03c72\n\u03b1. Thus \u03b1 denotes the prob-\n\n28.16\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nFig. 28.18\nability that a random sample produces a \u03c72-value\n> \u03c72\n\u03b1. So \u03c72\n\u03b1 represents the \u03c72-value such that the\narea under the chi-square curve to its (\u03c72\n\u03b1\u2019s) right is\nequal to \u03b1.\nFor various values of \u03b1 and \u03bd, the values of \u03c72\n\u03b1 are\npresented in the tables (A15 to A16)\nIn \u03c72 table, the left-hand column contains values\nof \u03bd, dof, the column headings are areas \u03b1 in the right\nhand tail of \u03c72-distribution curve, the table entries\nare values of \u03c72.\n28.8\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF\nVARIANCE s 2\nThe theoretical sampling distribution of the sam-\nple variance for random samples from normal pop-\nulation is related to the chi-squared distribution as\nfollows:\nLets2 bethevarianceofarandomsampleofsizen,\ntaken from a normal population having the variance\n\u03c3 2. Then\n\u03c72 = (n \u22121)s2\n\u03c3 2\n=\nn\n\u000e\ni=1\n(Xi \u2212X)2\n\u03c3 2\nis a value of a random variable having the\n\u03c72-distribution with \u03bd = n \u22121 dof.\nExactly 95% of \u03c72-distribution lies between \u03c72\n0.975\nand \u03c72\n0.025. When \u03c3 2 is too small, \u03c72-value falls to\nthe right of \u03c72\n0.025 and when \u03c3 2 is too large, \u03c72\nfalls to the left of \u03c72\n0.975. Thus when \u03c3 2 is correct,\n\u03c72-values falls to the left of \u03c72\n0.975 or to the right\nof \u03c72\n0.025.\n28.9\nF-DISTRIBUTION\nLet s2\n1 be the sample variance of an independent\nsample of size n1 drawn from a normal population\nN(\u00b51, \u03c3 2\n1 ). Similarly, let s2\n2 be the sample variance\nin an independent sample of size n2 drawn from\nanother normal population N(\u00b52, \u03c3 2\n2 ). Thus s2\n1 and\ns2\n2 are two variances of two random samples of sizes\nn1 and n2 respectively drawn from two normal popu-\nlation. In order to determine whether the two samples\ncome from two populations having equal variances,\nconsider the sampling distribution of the ratio of the\nvariances of the two independent random sample\nde\ufb01ned by\nF = s2\n1/\u03c31\ns2\n2/\u03c3 2\n2\n= \u03c3 2\n2 s2\n1\n\u03c3 2\n1 s2\n2\nwhich is an F-distribution with \u03bd1 = n1 \u22121 and\n\u03bd2 = n2 \u22121 degrees of freedom. Here F is used as\nmark of respect for Sir R.A. Fisher. F-distribution\nwas worked out by G.W. Snedecor. Under the hy-\npothesis that two normal populations have the same\nvariance i.e., \u03c3 2\n1 = \u03c3 2\n2 , we have\nF\u03bd1,\u03bd2 = s2\n1\ns2\n2\nF determines whether the ratio of two sample vari-\nances s1 and s2 is too small or too large.\nWhen F is close to 1, the two sample variances\ns1 and s2 are nearly same. It is customary, to take\nthe larger sample variance as the numerator. F-\ndistribution is related to the Beta distribution and the\ntwoparameters\u03bd1 and\u03bd2 areknownasnumeratorand\ndenominator degrees of freedom. The curve of the\nF-distribution depends not only on the two param-\neters \u03bd1 ande \u03bd2 but also on the order in which they\nare stated. F-distribution is also known as variance\nratio distribution. F is always a positive number. The\nF-distribution curve lies entirely in \ufb01rst quadrant and\nis unimodal.\nF\u03b1(\u03bd1, \u03bd2) is the value of F with \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 dof\nsuch that the area under the F-distribution curve to\nthe right of F\u03b1 is \u03b1. In tables (A17 to A20) F\u03b1 is\ntabulated (prepared by Snedecor) for \u03b1 = 0.05 and\n\u03b1 = 0.01 for various combinations of the dof \u03bd1 and\n\u03bd2. The values of F0.95 and F0.99 can be calculated\nfrom the above tables (A17 to A20) by using the\nfollowing result.\n\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\n28.17\nFig. 28.19\nF1\u2212\u03b1(\u03bd1, \u03bd2) =\n1\nF\u03b1(\u03bd2, \u03bd1)\nF-distribution is extremely useful in testing the\nequality of several population means, comparing\nsample variances, and forms the backbone of analy-\nsis of variance (ANOVA).\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nF-distribution\nExample 1:\nFor an F-distribution \ufb01nd\na.

So this\nmethod of estimate is known as \u201cpoint estimation\u201d\nwhere as the second method is known as \u201cinterval\nestimation\u201d since we are estimating the parameters\nenclosed in an interval.\nHypothesis testing main aim is to provide rules\nthat lead to decision resulting in acceptance or rejec-\ntion of statements about the population parameters.\nA man going to of\ufb01ce on a cloudy day is in a dilemma\nwhether to carry his umbrella or not. When the day\nbegins he has to take the decision although he is not\naware whether it rains or not. In any case, one of the\nfollowing is going to happen.\n(i) He takes his umbrella and it rains (wise deci-\nsion)\n(ii) He does not take his umbrella and it does not\nrain (wise decision again)\n(iii) He takes umbrella and does not rain (wrong\ndecision)\n(iv) He does not take his umbrella and it rains\n(wrong decision).\nThe situations (iii) and (iv) are undesirable.\nTest of goodness of \ufb01t is a statistical test which de-\ntermines whether the sample data are in conformity\nwith the hypothesized distribution. In fact this test\nliterally tests how good the \ufb01t is. It is based on how\nclose are the observed numbers and the numbers that\nwe expect from the hypothesized distribution.\n29.1\nPOINT ESTIMATION\nStatistical Estimation\nIt is a part of statistical inference where a popula-\ntion parameter is estimated from the corresponding\nsample statistics. An estimate of the unknown true or\nexact value of the parameter or an interval in which\nthe parameter is to be determined on the basis of\nsample data from the population.\nUnbiased estimator\nA statistic \u02c6\u03b8 is known as an unbiased estimator of the\ncorresponding parameter \u03b8 if\nE(\u02c6\u03b8) = E(statistic) = parameter = \u03b8\ni.e., the mean of the sampling distribution of estima-\ntor equals to \u03b8. Unbiasedness property is desirable,\nalthough not essential.\nPoint estimation\nPoint estimation of a parameter is a statistical esti-\nmation where the parameter is estimated by a single\nnumber (or value) from sample data.\n29.1\n\n29.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nMaximum Error of Estimate E\nSince the sample mean estimate very rarely equals\nto the mean of population \u00b5, a point estimate is gen-\nerally accompanied with a statement of error which\ngives difference between estimate and the quantity to\nbe estimated, the estimator. Thus error = x \u2212\u00b5. For\nlarge n, the random variable\nx\u2212\u00b5\n\u03c3/\u221an is normal variate\napproximately.

So instead of point esti-\nmation where the quantity to be estimated is re-\nplaced by a sigle value a better way of estimation is\ninterval estimation, which determines an interval in\nwhich the parameter lies. For a given sample of val-\nues of a population, interval estimation consists of\ndetermining an interval whose two end points are\ncomputed from the sample data. The interval esti-\n\n29.4\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nmate thus constructed is such that the probability of\nthe parameter lying in the interval can be determined.\nAccuracy of the estimate is indicated by the length\nof the interval. Thus interval estimates are intervals\nfor which one can be (1 \u2212\u03b1) 100% con\ufb01dent that\nthe parameter under investigation lies in this inter-\nval. Such an interval is known as con\ufb01dence inter-\nval for the parameter with (having) 1 \u2212\u03b1 or (1 \u2212\u03b1)\n100%degreeofcon\ufb01dence.Thetwoendpointsofthe\ncon\ufb01dence interval are known as con\ufb01dence limits\nor \ufb01ducial limits or critical values or con\ufb01dence\ncoef\ufb01cients.

Statistical inference consists of two\nmajor areas, estimation and tests of hypothesis.\nEstimation was discussed in Sections 29.1, 29.2 and\n29.3. In tests of hypothesis, a postulate or conjecture\nor statement about a parameter of the population is\ntested for its validity or truthfulness.\nStatistical decisions\nStatistical decisions are decisions or conclusions\nabout the population parameters on the basis of a\nrandom sample from the population.\nStatistical Hypothesis\nIt is an assumption or conjecture or guess about the\nparameter(s) of population distribution(s). The sta-\ntisticalhypothesisisestablishedbeforehandandmay\nor may not be true. When more than one population\nis considered, statistical hypothesis consists of rela-\ntionship between the parameters of the populations.\nNull Hypothesis\nIt is (N.H.) denoted by H0 is the statistical hypoth-\nesis which is to be actually tested for acceptance or\nrejection. N.H. is the hypothesis which is tested for\npossible rejection under the assumption that it is true\n(R.A. Fisher).\nAlternative Hypothesis\n(A.H.) denoted by H1, is any hypothesis other than\nthe null hypothesis. Neyman originated the concept\nof alternative hypothesis.\nTest of Hypothesis\nTest of hypothesis or test of signi\ufb01cance or rules of\ndecision is a procedure to decide whether to accept\nor reject the (null) hypothesis. This test determines\nwhether observed samples differ signi\ufb01cantly from\nexpected results. Acceptance of hypothesis merely\nindicates that the data do not give suf\ufb01cient evidence\nto refute the hypothesis. Whereas, rejection is a \ufb01rm\nconclusion where the sample evidence refutes it.\nWhen N.H. is accepted, result is said to be\nnon-signi\ufb01cant i.e., observed differences are due to\n\u2018chance\u2019 caused by the process of sampling. When\nN.H. is rejected (i.e., A.H. is accepted) the result is\nsaid to be signi\ufb01cant. Thus test of hypothesis decides\nwhether a statement concerning a parameter is true\nor false instead of estimating the value of the param-\neter. Since the test is based on sample observations,\nthe decision of acceptance or rejection of the null hy-\npothesis is always subjected to some error i.e., some\namount of risk.\nTypes of errors in test of hypothesis:\nAccept H0\nReject H0\nH0 is true\ncorrect decision\nType I error\nH0 is false\nType II error\ncorrect decision\nType I error\ninvolves rejection of null hypoth-\nesis when it should be accepted (as true).\nType II error\ninvolves acceptance of the null hy-\npothesis when it is false and should be rejected.\n\n29.8\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nLevel of signi\ufb01cance\n(L.O.S.) of a test denoted by \u03b1 is the probability of\ncommitting type I error. Thus L.O.S. measures the\namount of risk or error associated in taking decisions.\nIt is costomary to \ufb01x \u03b1 before sample information is\ncollected and to choose (take) generally \u03b1 as 0.05\nor 0.01. L.O.S. \u03b1 = 0.01 is used for high precision\nand \u03b1 = 0.05 for moderate precision. L.O.S. is also\nexpressedaspercentage.ThusL.O.S.\u03b1 = 5%means\nthere are 5 chances in 100 that N.H. is rejected when\nit is true or one is 95% con\ufb01dent that a right decision\nis made. L.O.S. is also known as the size of the test.\nThus \u03b1 = probability of committing type I error = P\n(reject H0/H0) = \u03b1 and \u03b2 = prob (type II error)= P\n(accept H0/H1) = \u03b2.\nPower of the test is computed as 1 \u2212\u03b2.\nNote 1:\nWhen the size of the sample is increased,\nthe probability of committing both types of errors\nI and II i.e., \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be reduced simultaneously.\nNote 2:\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are known as producer\u2019s risk and\nconsumer\u2019s risk respectively.\nNote 3:\nWhen both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, the test pro-\ncedure is good one giving good chance of making\nthe correct decision.\nSimple Hypothesis\nIt is a statistical hypothesis which completely spec-\ni\ufb01es an exact parameter. Null hypothesis is always\na simple hypothesis stated as an equality specifying\nan exact value of the parameter (includes any value\nnot stated by A.H.).\nExamples:\n1. N.H. = H0 : \u00b5 = \u00b50\ni.e., population mean equals to a speci\ufb01ed con-\nstant \u00b50.\n2. N.H. = H0 : \u00b51 \u2212\u00b52 = \u03b4\ni.e., the difference between the sample means\nequals to a constant \u03b4.\nComposite Hypothesis\nIt is stated in terms of several possible values i.e., by\nan inequality.\nAlternative Hypothesis\nIt is a composite hypothesis involving statements ex-\npressed as inequalities such as <, > or  =.\nExamples:\n1. A.H.: H1; \u00b5 > \u00b50\n2. A.H.: H1 : \u00b5 < \u00b50\n3. A.H.: H1 : \u00b5  = \u00b50\nCritical Region (C.R.)\nIn any test of hypothesis, a test statistic S\u2217, calcu-\nlated from the sample data, is used to accept or reject\nthe null hypothesis of the test. Consider the area un-\nder the probability curve of the sampling distribution\nof the test statistic S\u2217which follows some known\n(given) distribution. This area under the probability\ncurve is divided into to dichotomous regions, namely\nthe region of rejection (signi\ufb01cant region or critical\nregion) where N.H. is rejected, and the region of ac-\nceptance (non-signi\ufb01cant region or non-critical re-\ngion) where N.H. is accepted. Thus critical region\nis the region of rejection of N.H. The area of the crit-\nical region equals to the level of signi\ufb01cance \u03b1. Note\nthat C.R. always lies on the tail (s) of the distribu-\ntion. Depending on the nature of A.H., C.R. may lie\non one side or both sides of the tails (s).\nCritical value(s) or signi\ufb01cant value(s)\nIt is (area) the value of the test statistic S\u2217\n\u03b1 (for given\nlevel of signi\ufb01cance \u03b1) which divides (or separates)\nthe area under the probability curve into critical (or\nrejection) region and non-critical (or acceptance) re-\ngion.\nOne tailed test (O.T.T.) and two tailed test\n(T.T.T.)\nRight one tailed test (R.O.T.T.):\nWhen the alter-\nnative hypothesis (A.H.): H1 is of the greater than\ntype i.e., H1 : \u00b5 > \u00b50 or H1 : \u03c3 2\n1 > \u03c3 2\n2 etc., then the\nentire criticial region of area \u03b1 lies on the right side\ntail of the probability density curve as shown shaded\nin the Fig. 29.3. In such case, the test of hypothesis\n(T.O.H.) is known as right one tailed test.\n\nESTIMATION AND TEST OF HYPOTHESIS\n29.9\nFig. 29.3\nC.R. of area a\nLeft one tailed test (L.O.T.T.)\nWhen the A.H.: H1 is of the less than type i.e., H1\n\u00b51 < \u00b50 or H1 : \u03c3 2\n1 < \u03c3 2\n2 etc. then the entire C.R. of\narea \u03b1 lies on the left side tail of the curve as shown\nin Fig. 29.4.\nFig. 29.4\nC.R. of area a\nTwo tailed test (T.T.T.)\nIf A.H. is of the not equals type i.e., H1 : \u00b51  = \u00b52 or\nH1 : \u03c31  = \u03c32 etc. then the C.R. lies on both sides of\nthe right and left tails of the curve such that the C.R.\nof area \u03b1\n2 lies on the right tail and C.R. of area \u03b1\n2 lies\non the left tail, as shown in Fig. 29.5.\nFig. 29.5\nC.R. of\narea a/2\nThus the test of hypothesis or test of signi\ufb01cance or\nrule of decision consists of the following six steps.\n1. Formulate N.H.: H0.\n2. Formulate A.H.: H1.\n3. Choose L.O.S.: \u03b1.\n4. C.R.:isdeterminedbythecriticalvalueS\u2217\n\u03b1 andthe\nkind of A.H. (based on which the test is R.O.T.T.\nor L.O.T.T. or T.T.T.).\n5. ComputetheteststatisticS\u2217usingthesampledata.\n6. Decision: Accept or reject N.H. depending on the\nrelation between S\u2217and S\u2217\n\u03b1.\nP-Value\nIn tests of hypothesis, preselection of a signi\ufb01cance\nlevel \u03b1 does not account for values of test statis-\ntics that are \u201cclose\u201d to the critical region. Thus a test\nstatistic value that is non-signi\ufb01cant say for \u03b1 = 0.05\nmay become signi\ufb01cant for \u03b1 = 0.01. In applied\nstatistics, P-value approach is designed to give the\nuser an alternative (in terms of probability) to a mere\n\u201creject\u201d or \u201cdo not reject\u201d conclusion.\nP-Value\nis the lowest level (of signi\ufb01cance) at\nwhich the observed value of the test statistic is sig-\nni\ufb01cant.\nIn the signi\ufb01cance testing by P-Value approch, \u03b1\nis not pre-determined but the conclusion is based on\nthe size of the P-Value which is computed using the\nvalue of test statistic.\n29.5\nTEST OF HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING\nSINGLE POPULATION MEAN \u00b5:\n(WITH KNOWN VARIANCE \u03c3 2:\nLARGE SAMPLE)\nLet \u00b5 and \u03c3 2 be the mean and variance of a pop-\nulation from which a random sample of size n is\ndrawn. Let x be the mean of the sample. Then for\nlarge samples (n \u226530), from central theorem it fol-\nlows that the sampling distribution of x is approxi-\nmately normally distributed with mean \u00b5 x = \u00b5 and\n\u03c3 2\nx = \u03c3 2\nn .\nThe test statistic for single mean with known vari-\nance is Z = x\u2212\u00b50\n\u03c3/\u221an.\nTo test whether the population mean \u00b5 equals to a\nspeci\ufb01ed constant \u00b50 or not, formulate the test of\nhypothesis as follows:\n1. N.H.: \u00b5 = \u00b50.\n2. A.H.: \u00b5  = \u00b50.\n3. L.O.S.: \u03b1.\n4. C.R.: Since the A.H. is a not equal to type, a\nT.T.T. is considered. For given \u03b1, critical values\n\n29.10\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\n\u2212Z\u03b1/2 and +Z\u03b1/2 are determined from normal\ntable since normal distribution is assumed. For\nexample, for \u03b1 = 5% or 0.05 from normal table\n\u2212Z0.025 = \u22121.96 and Z0.025 = 1.96. Thus the\ncritical region consists of the two shaded regions\nin Fig. 29.6 i.e., reject N.H.: H0 if Z < \u2212Z\u03b1/2 or\nZ > Z\u03b1/2.\nFig. 29.6\n5. Compute the test statistic Z, denoted by Zcal or\nsimply Z by\nZ = x \u2212\u00b50\n\u03c3/\u221an\nHere x, the mean of the sample of size n, is cal-\nculated from the sample data.\n6. Conclusion: Reject H0 if Zcal or Z falls in\nthe critical region i.e., observed sample statis-\ntic is probably signi\ufb01cant or highly signi\ufb01cant\nat \u03b1 level. Otherwise accept H0 (if \u2212Z\u03b1/2 < Z\n< Z\u03b1/2).\nNote 1:\nSuppose the A.H. is H1 : \u00b5 > \u00b50. Then\nthe critical region is given by Z > Z\u03b1 since we\nconsider a right one tail test is this case, i.e.,\nreject H0 if Z > Z\u03b1 otherwise accept H0 (if\nZ < Z\u03b1) (see Fig. 29.7).\nNote 2:\nIf A.H. is H1 : \u00b5 < \u00b50 then consider a left\none tail test with C.R. given by Z < \u2212Z\u03b1 as shown\nin Fig. 29.8, i.e., reject H0 is Z < \u2212Z\u03b1 otherwise\naccept H0 (if Z > \u2212Z\u03b1).\nNote 3:\nReference table of critical values for a\ngiven L.O.S. \u03b1 for T.T.T., R.O.T.T. and L.O.T.T.\nFig. 29.7\nN\nFig. 29.8\n\u03b1%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n4%\n1%\n.5%\n.2%\n\u03b1\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0.04\n0.01 0.005 0.002\n\u2212Z\u03b1/2 and \u22121.44 \u22121.645\n\u22121.96 \u22122.06 \u22122.58 \u22122.81 \u22123.08\n+Z\u03b1/2\nand\nand\nand\nand\nand\nand\nand\nfor T.T.T.\n1.44\n1.645\n1.96\n2.06\n2.58\n2.81\n3.08\n\u2212Z\u03b1 for\nL.O.T.T.\n\u22121.04\n\u22121.28 \u22121.645\n\u22122.6 \u22122.33 \u22122.58 \u22122.88\nZ\u03b1 for\nR.O.T.T.\n1.04\n1.28\n1.645\n2.6\n2.33\n2.58\n2.88\nNote 4:\nFor large sample n \u226530, even if \u03c3 is\nunknown, \u03c3 can be replaced by sample variances\n(which can be computed from sample information).\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nTest of hypothesis: For one mean\nExample 1:\nThe length of life X of certain comput-\ners is approximately normally distributed with mean\n\nESTIMATION AND TEST OF HYPOTHESIS\n29.11\n800 hours and standard deviation 40 hours.

Let x2 be the mean of an independent random\nsample of size n2 drawn from another population\nwith mean \u00b52 and variance \u03c3 2\n2 . To test the hypothesis\nfor difference of means, consider the null hypothe-\nsis \u00b51 \u2212\u00b52 = \u03b4 = given constant. So when \u03b4 = 0,\nthere is no difference between the means i.e., the\ntwo populations have the same means. If \u03b4  = 0, the\nmeans of the two populations are different. In these\ncases, the test statistic will depend on the difference\nbetween the sample means x1 \u2212x2 and is given by\nZ = (x1 \u2212x2) \u2212\u03b4\n\u03c3x1\u2212x2\nHere it is assumed that both samples are drawn from\nnormal populations with known variances.\nHere Z follows standard normal distribution. If the\ntwo populations are in\ufb01nite then the variance of\nthe sampling distribution of the difference between\nthe sample means is\n\u03c3 2\nx1\u2212x2 = \u03c3 2\n1\nn1\n+ \u03c3 2\n2\nn2\nSubstituting we have the statistic for test concerning\ndifference between two means as\nZ = (x1 \u2212x2) \u2212\u03b4\n \n\u03c3 2\n1\nn1 +\n\u03c3 2\n2\nn2\nNote:\nWhen the two variances \u03c3 2\n1 and \u03c3 2\n2 are un-\nknown, they can be replaced by sample variances s2\n1\nand s2\n2 provided both the samples are large (n1, n2 \u2265\n30). In this case the test statistic is\nZ = (x1 \u2212x2) \u2212\u03b4\n \ns2\n1\nn1\n+ s2\n2\nn2\nThe critical regions for testing \u00b51 \u2212\u00b52 = \u03b4 are:\n1.

Then the\npooling varience \u03c3 2 is given by\n\u03c3 2 =\n (xi1 \u2212x1)2 +  (x2i \u2212x2)2\nn1 + n2 \u22122\n= (n1 \u22121)s2\n1 + (n2 \u22121)s2\n2\nn1 + n2 \u22122\nwhere x, s2\n1 and x2, s2\n2 are the mean and variance\nof two samples of size n1 and n2 respectively. In a\ntest concerning the difference between the means for\nsmall samples, the t-test statistic is\nt = (x1 \u2212x2) \u2212\u03b4\n\u03c3x1\u2212x2\nwith n1 + n2 \u22122 degrees of freedom. This test is\nalso known as two-sample pooled t-test.

For example when A.H. is\n\u00b51 \u2212\u00b52  = \u03b4, then the critical region (Reject H0) is\nt < \u2212t\u03b1/2, n1 + n2 \u22122\nor\nt > t\u03b1/2, n1 + n2 \u22122.\nNote 1:\nThe critical values are given when n1 +\nn2 \u22122 \u226530 (although n1 and n2 are small).\nNote 2:\nThe two-sample t-test can not be used if\n\u03c31  = \u03c32.\nNote 3:\nThe two-sample t-test can not be used for\n\u201cbefore and after\u201d kind of data, where the data is\nnaturally paired.

Curve \ufb01tting\nis the process of \ufb01nding the \"best \ufb01t\" curve since\ndifferent approximating curves can be obtained for\nthe same data. Least squares method is the best curve\n\ufb01tting method and is easily implemented on comput-\ners than the other methods like method of moments,\nmethod of group averages, graphical method.We also\nconsider curve \ufb01tting by a sum of exponentials, lin-\near weighted and non-linear weighted least squares\napproximation.\nIn the unvariate case, a single variable say the\nheight of an Indian, is analyzed. Whereas in the bi-\nvariate case, two \"numerical\" variables are measured\nresulting in a pair of measurements for each mem-\nber, say the height and weight of an Indian; the age\nand the blood pressure of a person; amount spent\non advertising and volume of sales; intake of nutri-\nous food and I.Q of a student etc. In the correlation\nanalysis, one wish to \ufb01nd whether a (mathematical)\nrelationship exists and measure the strength of such\nrelationship. In the regression analysis, the exact na-\nture and form of mathematical equation (of the re-\nlation) is obtaned. While the correlation coef\ufb01cient\nmeasures the \"closeness\", the \"regression equation\"\nis used for prediction (or estimation).\n30.1\nCURVE FITTING\nIt is the method of \ufb01nding equation of a curve that\napproximates a given set of data. On the basis of this\nmathematical equation, predictions can be made in\nmany statistical investigations.\nRelationship\nRelationship (or association) between two (or more)\nvariables may exist.\nExamples:\nBlood pressure and age, rainfall and\ncrop yield, volume of a cube and length of its side,\nconsumption of food and weight gain, intake of drug\nand heart rate, height and weight, income and medi-\ncal care, nutrition and I.Q.\nScatter Diagram\nTo \ufb01nd a mathematical relationship (equation) be-\ntween say two variables X and Y, plot the set\nof given N paired observations of X and Y i.e.,\n(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN, YN) in the XY-plane.\nThe resulting set of points is known as a scatter dia-\ngram.\nApproximating Curve\nIt is a smooth curve that approximates the given set\nof N data points plotted in the scatter diagram.\nCollocational polynomial\nFor unequally spaced\nXi\u2019s N coef\ufb01cients a0, a1, a2, . . . , aN\u22121 in the col-\nlocational polynomial\nY(X) = a0 + a1X + a2X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + aN\u22121XN\u22121\ncan be determined so that the given set of N data\npoints (X1, Y1), . . .

Collocation becomes labo-\nrious when the number of data points N is large and\nthe empirical or observed data contains errors (i.e.,\nwhen X or Y or both are random variables). In such\ncases data may be approximated by some function\nY = f (x) containing few unknown parameters.\nBest \ufb01tting curve by method of least squares\nLet\n(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . .

Let di = Yi \u2212\u02c6Yi denotes the difference\nbetween Yi and the corresponding value\nYi estimate = Yi est = \u02c6Yi = f (Xi)\ndetermined from the curve c: y = f (X) (Fig.\n30.1). The di\u2019s known as deviations, errors or resid-\nuals which may be positive or negative or zero. Then\nthe Legendre\u2019s principle of least squares (L.S.) or\nleast squares criteria states that, of all the curves ap-\nproximating a given set of data points, the curve hav-\ning the least or minimum sum of the squares of the\ndeviations is the \u201cbest \ufb01tting\u201d curve, i.e.,\nN \ni=1\nd2\ni the\nresiduals or error sum of squares, is minimum.\nSuch a curve is known as a least squares (L.S.)\ncurve. Thus the least squares criteria is the measure\n\u201cgoodness of \ufb01t\u201d. If the curve is a straight line \ufb01tted\naccording to least squares sense then it is known as\nleast squares straight line; if it is a parabola, it is\nknown as least squares parabola, etc.\nSome standard approximating curves\n1.

It is mainly used\nto predict or estimate one (the dependent) variable\n(response) in terms of the other (independent)\nvariable(s), (regressor(s)). It is also used in opti-\nmization, to determine the values of independent\nvariable(s) for which the dependent variable attains\nmaximum or minimum.

Similarly, if\nX depends on Y, then\nX = b0 + b1Y\nis known as regression line of X on Y.\nIn multiple regression the equation is\nY = f (X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xk)\nIn multiple linear regression, f is linear\ni.e.,\nY = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + bkXk\nIn multiple nonlinear regression, f is nonlinear, for\nexample,\ni.e., Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X1X2 + b4X2\n1 + b5X2\n2.\n\nCURVE FITTING, REGRESSION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS\n30.5\n30.3\nINFERENCES BASED ON THE\nLEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION\nSimple linear regression model consists of\nY = \u03b1 + \u03b2x +  \nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are unknown intercept and slope\nparameters respectively.

Least squares \ufb01tting\nis a maximum likelihood estimation of the \ufb01tted pa-\nrameters if the measurement errors are independent\nand normally distributed with constant standard de-\nviation. The least squares principle is to minimize\nthe sum of the squares of the errors.

When a\ndiscrete data point (x\u2217, y\u2217) is more reliable (or accu-\nrate) than the other data, a larger weight is assigned\nto (x\u2217, y\u2217). If all the data points have the same accu-\nracy then equal weights are assigned i.e., wi = 1 for\ni = 1 to N.\nFor continuous (data) function, an integrable func-\ntion w(x) is called a weight function on [a, b] of\nw(x) \u22650 for x \u2208[a, b].

However, in problems in economics,\nbiology or social sciences we will be interested in the\nstudy of statistical methods analyzing two or more\n(bivariate or multivariate) variables. In such cases the\nconcept of joint probability distribution is required.\nMarkov* chains, involving calculation of high power\nof matrices, are powerful tool for forecasting future\nevents.\n31.1\nJOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION\nLet S be a sample space associated with a random\nexperiment \u03b5. Let X = X(s) and Y = Y(s) be two\nrandom variables on the same sample space S. The\ntwo real valued functions X(s) and Y(s) each assign\na real number to each outcome s of the sample space\nS, with respective image sets given by\nX(s) = {X(s1), X(s2), . . . , X(sn)}={X1, X2, . . . , Xn}\nand Y(s) = {Y(s1), Y(s2), . . . , Y(sm)}={Y1, Y2, . . . , Ym}\nHere the two random variables X and Y are\ndiscrete since the possible values of X and Y are\n\ufb01nite (or countably in\ufb01nite).\nExample:\na. X: Age, Y: Blood pressure of a person.\n* Andrei Andrejevtich Markov (1856-1922), Russian mathemati-\ncian\nb. X: Crop yield, Y: Rain fall in an area.\nc.

In other words,\nwhen X and Y are independent, each entry h(xi, yj)\nis obtained as the product of its marginal entries.

Further\nin box A, two red, one white and 4 black marbles\nare defective while in box B one red and 2 white\nmarbles are defective. To determine the probability\nthat a marble drawn at random is say a defective red\nmarble, we have to conduct a sequence of experi-\nments in which each experiment has a \ufb01nite number\nof outcomes with given probabilities as shown in the\ntree diagram below (Fig. 31.2).\nFig. 31.2\nThe four experiments are: toss a die, choose a\nbox, draw a marble and decide whether it is defec-\ntive.

In this case the state space\nis assumed to be I = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Thus a (\ufb01nite)\nstochastic process consists of a sequence of experi-\nments in which each experiment has a \ufb01nite number\nof outcomes with given probabilities.\nExample:\nJobs arrive at random points in time,\nqueue for service and depart after service comple-\ntion. If Nk denotes the number of jobs at the time\nof departure of the kth job (customer) then {Nk|k =\n1, 2, . . .} is a stochastic process.\nA Markov (memoryless) process is a stochastic\nprocess whose entire past history is summarized in\nits current (present) state. i.e., the \u201cfuture\u201d is inde-\npendent of its \u201cpast\u201d.\nMarkov chain\nIt is a Markov process in which the state space I is\ndiscrete (\ufb01nite or countably in\ufb01nite). Thus a (\ufb01nite)\nMarkov chain is a \ufb01nite stochastic process consisting\nof a sequence of trials whose outcomes say x1, x2, . . .\nsatisfy the following two conditions:\n(a) Each outcome belongs to the state space I =\n{a1, a2, . . . , am}, which is the \ufb01nite set of\noutcomes.\n(b) The outcome of any trial depends at most upon\nthe outcome of the immediately preceding trial\nand not upon any other previous outcomes. This\nMarkov property can be stated as\nP\n \nXn = in\n    X0 = io, X1 = i1, . . . , Xn\u22121 = in\u22121\n \n= P\n \nXn = in\n    Xn\u22121 = in\u22121\n \n.\nNow the system is said to be in state \u2018ai\u2019 at time n\nor at the nth step if ai is the outcome on the nth\ntrial. Associated with each ordered pair of states\n(ai, aj), the number pij gives the probability that\nsystem changes from ith state to jth state. In other\nwords, pij is the probability that aj occurs immedi-\nately after ai occurs. The numbers pij are known as\ntransition probabilities.\nTransition matrix\nP is square matrix of the transition probabilities pij:\nThe ith row of P namely (pi1, pi2, . . . , pim) repre-\nsents the probabilities of that system will change\nfrom ai to a1, a2, a3, . . . , am.\nProbability vector\nIt is a vector v = (v1, v2, . . . , vn), if vi \u22650 for every\ni and\nn\n \ni=1\nvi = 1.\nNote:\nA vector whose components are non-\nnegative, but their sum is not one, can be converted\ninto a probability vector by dividing each component\nby the sum of the components.\nStochastic matrix\nP is a square matrix with each row being a proba-\nbility vector. In other words, all the entries of P are\nnon-negative and the sum of the entries of any row\nis one.\nA vector v is said to be a \ufb01xed vector or a \ufb01xed\npoint of a matrix A if vA = v and v  = 0.\nObviously if v is a \ufb01xed vector of A, so is kv since\n(kv)A = k(vA) = k(v) = kv.\nTheorem 1: If v = (v1v2v3) is a probability vector\nof a stochastic matrix P =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\na1\nb1\nc1\na2\nb2\nc2\na3\nb3\nc3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8then vP\nis also a probability vector.\nProof:\nvP = (v1v2v3)1\u00d73\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\na1\nb1\nc1\na2\nb2\nc2\na3\nb3\nc3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n3\u00d73\n= (v1a1 + v2a2 + v3a3, v1b1 + v2b2\n+v3b3, v1c1 + v2c2 + v3c3).\nSince ai, bi, ci, vi are all non-negative for any i, the\ncomponents of vP are all non-negative. Now the sum\n\nJOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND MARKOV CHAINS\n31.9\nof the components of vP is\n(v1a1 + v2a2 + v3a3) + (v1b1 + v2b2 + v3b3)\n+(v1c1 + v2c2 + v3c3)\n=v1(a1+b1+c1)+v2(a2+b2+c2)+v3(a3+b3+c3)\n= v1 \u00b7 1 + v2 \u00b7 1 + v3 \u00b7 1 = v1 + v2 + v3 = 1, since\nP is a stochastic matrix and v is given probability\nvector.\nGeneral result: If v = (v1v2v3 . . . vn) is a proba-\nbility vector of a n square stochastic matrix P then\nvP is also a probability vector.\nTheorem 2: If P and Q are stochastic matrices\nthen their product PQ is also stochastic matrix.\nThus P n is stochastic matrix for all positive integer\nvalues of n.\nProof:\nThe ith row of PQ is the product of ith row\nof P with matrix Q. Since P and Q are stochastic\nmatrices, ith row of P is a probability vector and by\nprevious Theorem 1, ith row of P with matrix Q is\nalsoaprobabilityvectorandhencePQisastochastic\nmatrix. If P = Q, then PQ = P 2 is stochastic and\nin general P n is stochastic for n positive integer.\nTheorem 3: Let t = (t1t2 . . . tm) be a vector and T be\na square matrix whose rows are each the same vector\nt.

The sum\nof the elements (pi1, pi2,...,pim) of any ith row is one,\nbecause they represent the probabilities of all the\npossible outcomes of transition from state ai to the\nstates a1, a2, . . . , ai, . . . , am. Thus each row of P\nis a probability vector. Therefore P is a stochastic\nmatrix.\nA Stochastic matrix P is said to be regular if all\nthe entries of some power P m are positive.\nTheorem 5: Let P be a regular stochastic matrix.\nThen\n(a) P has a unique \ufb01xed probability vector t and the\ncomponents of t are all positive.\n(b) The sequence P, P 2, P 3 . . . of powers of P\napproaches the matrix T whose rows are each\nthe \ufb01xed point t.\n(c) If p is any probability vector, then the sequence\nof vectors pP, pP 2, pP 3, . . . approaches the\n\ufb01xed point t.\nNote:\nHere matrix A approaches matrix B, means\nevery entry of A approaches the corresponding entry\nof B.\nHigher Transition Probabilities\nOne-step transition probabilities\nThe entry pij in the transition probability matrix P\nis the probability that the system moves from the\nstate ai to the state aj in one step i.e., ai \u2192aj.\nThe one-step transition probabilities in P can also\nbe described by a directed graph known as state-\ntransition diagram or simply transition diagram of\nthe Markov chain. A node labelled i of the transi-\ntion diagram represents state i of the Markov chain.\nA branch labeled pij from node i to j represents\nthe conditional probability (or the one-step transi-\ntion probabilities) de\ufb01ned by\npij = P\n \nXn = j\n    Xn\u22121 = i\n \nn-step Transition Probabilities\nThe probability that a Markov chain will move from\nstate i to state j in exactly n steps, is denoted by\npij(n) or p(n)\nij and is given by\np(n)\nij = pij(n) = P\n \nXm+n = j\n    Xm = i\n \n\n31.10\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\ni.e.,\nai \u2192ak1 \u2192ak2 \u2192\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192akn\u22121 \u2192aj.\nEvaluation of n-step Transition Probability\nMatrix P (n) or P(n)\nusing Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\npij(m + n) =\n \nk\npik(m)pkj(n).\nLet P (n) or P(n) represent a matrix whose (i, j)th\nentry is p(n)\nij or pij(n). Putting m = 1 and n = n \u22121\nin the above C-K equation, P (n) or P(n) the n-step\ntransition probabilities matrix can be written as\nP (n) = P(n) = P \u00b7 P(n \u22121) = PPP(n \u22122) = P n.\nThus the matrix of n-step transition probabilities P (n)\nis obtained by multiplying the matrix of one step\ntransition probabilities P by itself n \u22121 times.\nTheorem 6: If P is the transition matrix of a Markov\nchain, then the n-step transition matrix P (n) is equal\nto the nth power of P , i.e., P (n) = P n.\nIn other words, the problem of \ufb01nding the n-step\ntransition probabilities is reduced to one of forming\npowers of a given matrix.\nProbabilitydistributionofthesystematsomearbi-\ntrary time is denoted by the probability vector.\np = (p1, p2, pi, . . . , pm)\nwhere pi denotes the probability that the system is in\nstate ai. At time t = 0, when the process begins, the\ncorresponding probability vector\np(0) = (p(0)\n1 , p(0)\n2 , . . . , p(0)\ni , . . . , p(0)\nm )\ndenotes the initial probability distribution. Similarly,\nthe nth step probability distribution i.e., the distribu-\ntion after the \ufb01rst n-steps is denoted by\np(n) = (p(n)\n1 , p(n)\n2 , . . . , p(n)\nm ).\nNow the (marginal) pmf of the random variable\nXn can be obtained from the n-step transition prob-\nabilities and the initial distribution as follows\np(n) = p(0)P (n) = p(0)P n\nThus the probability distributions of a homogeneous\nMarkov chain are completely determined from the\none-step transition probability matrix P and the\ninitial probability distribution p(0).\nTheorem 7: The probability distribution of the\nsystem n-steps later is given by\np(n) = p(0)P n\ni.e.,\np(1) = p(0)P, p(2) = p(1)P = p(0)PP = p(0)P 2\np(3) = p(2)P = p(0)P 2P = p(0)P 3\netc.\nStationary Distribution of Regular\nMarkov Chains\nTheorem 7: Let P be a regular transition matrix of a\nMarkov chain. Then in the long run, the probability\nthat any state aj occurs is approximately equal to the\ncomponent tj of the unique \ufb01xed probability vector t\nof P .\nProof:\nSuppose the Markov chain is regular, i.e.,\nP is regular, then by Theorem 5, the sequence of\nn-step transition matrices P n approaches the matrix\nT , whose rows are each the unique \ufb01xed probability\nvector t of P . Hence the probability pij(n) that aj\noccurs for suf\ufb01ciently large n is independent of the\noriginal state ai and it approaches the component tj\nof t.\nStationary distribution\nStationary distribution of a Markov chain is the\nunique \ufb01xed probability vector t of the regular tran-\nsition matrix P of the Markov chain because every\nsequence of probability distributions approaches t.\nAbsorbing States\nA state ai of a Markov chain is said to be an absorbing\nstateifthesystemremainsinthestateai onceitenters\nthere, i.e., a state ai is absorbing if pii = 1. Thus once\na Markov chain enters such an absorbing state, it is\ndestined there to remain forever. In other words the\nith row in P has 1 at the main diagonal (i, i) position\nand zeros everywhere else.\nTheorem 8: A stochastic matrix P is not regular if\na 1 occurs in the principal main diagonal.\nProof:\nSuppose ai is the absorbing state of the\ngiven Markov chain whose transition matrix is P.\nThen 1 occurs in the (i, i) position and the ith row\n\nJOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND MARKOV CHAINS\n31.11\nof P is of the form (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0). When\npowers of P are calculated the ith row of P n persists\nto contain (0 0 0 . . . , 1, 0 . . . 0). Thus for i  = j (non\ndiagonal elements), the n-step transition probability\np(n)\nij = 0 for any n. Thus every power of P contains\nsome zero elements. Therefore P is not regular.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nProbability vector and stochastic matrix\nExample 1:\nWhich vectors are probability vectors\n(i)\n 1\n4, 3\n2, \u22121\n4, 1\n2\n \n(ii)\n 5\n2, 0, 8\n3, 1\n6, 1\n6\n \n(iii)\n 1\n12, 1\n2, 1\n6, 0, 1\n4\n \n(iv) (3, 0, 2, 5, 3)\nSolution:\n(i) is not a probability vector because negative\nentry\n \n\u22121\n4\n \n(ii) is not because the sum of the components do\nnot add up to 1\n(iii) is a probability vector because all the entries are\nnon-negative and sum 1\n12+ 1\n2+ 1\n6+ 1\n4= 12\n12=1.\n(iv) Dividing by 3 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 13, we get\nthe probability vector\n 3\n13, 0, 2\n13, 5\n13, 3\n13\n \n.\nExample 2:\nWhich matrices are stochastic\n(i)\n 0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n4\n \n(ii)\n 1\n0\n0\n1\n \n(iii)\n 0\n1\n1\n2\n1\n4\n \n(iv)\n 1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n \n(v)\n \n0\n1\n\u22121\n2\n3\n2\n \n.\nSolution:\n(i), (iii), (v) are not stochastic because (i)\nis not square (iii) last row sum is not 1 (v) negative\nentry (ii) & (iv) are stochastic matrices: each row\nsum is one, entries non-negative.\nExample 3:\nWhich of the stochastic matrices are\nregular\n(i) A =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n4\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(ii) B =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n1\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(iii) C =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nSolution:\n(i) not regular since 1 lies on the main diagonal.\n(ii) B2 = B \u00b7 B =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n3\n8\n3\n8\n1\n4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n,\nB3 = B2B =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n7\n16\n7\n16\n1\n8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nsince entries b13, b23 are zero, B is not regular\n(iii) C2 = C \u00b7 C =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n,\nC3 = C \u00b7 C2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1\n4\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nC4 = C3 \u00b7 C =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1\n4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n,\n\n31.12\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VII\nC5 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n8\n1\n2\n3\n8\n1\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n.\nSince all the entries of some power of C are\npositive, C is regular stochastic matrix.\nFixed probability vectors\nExample 4: Show that v = (b a) is \ufb01xed point of\nthe stochastic matrix P =\n 1 \u2212a\na\nb\n1 \u2212b\n \n.\nSolution:\nvP = (b a)\n 1 \u2212a\na\nb\n1 \u2212b\n \n=\n(b \u2212ab + ab\nba + a \u2212ab) = (b a) = v.\nExample 5:\n(a) Find the unique \ufb01xed probability vector t of\nP =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(b) What matrix does P n approach?\n(c) What vector does\n 1\n4, 1\n4, 1\n2\n \nP n approach?\nSolution:\n(a) Let t = (x, y, z) be the \ufb01xed probability vector.\nBy de\ufb01nition x + y + z = 1.

Accordingly the\n\ufb01rst row of the transition matrix (T.M.) is (0, 1, 0).\nNow suppose the system is in a1. It can move to state\na0, iff red from A and white from B with probability\n1\n2 \u00b7 1\n4 = 1\n8. Thus p10 = 1\n8. The system can move from\na1 to a2, iff white from A and red from B with proba-\nbility 1\n2 \u00b7 3\n4 = 3\n8 i.e., p12 = 3\n8, probability that system\nwill remain in a1 itself is 1 \u22121\n8 \u22123\n8 = 1\n2. (Note:\nwhite from A and white from B with probability\n1\n2 \u00b7 1\n4 = 1\n8 or red from A and red from B with prob-\nability 1\n2 \u00b7 3\n4 = 3\n8. Thus the probability that system\nwill remain in state a1 itself is 1\n8 + 3\n8 = 1\n2). Thus the\n2nd row of T.M. is\n 1\n8, 1\n2, 3\n8\n \n.\nFinally, suppose the system is in state a2. Note\nthat the system can never move from state a2 to a0.\nHowever, it may remain in a2 itself, if a red from\nA and red from B is chosen. In this case the proba-\nbility is 1\n1 \u00b7 2\n4 = 1\n2. Lastly, if a red from A and white\nfrom B is chosen, then system moves from a2 to\na1 with probability 2\n4 = 1\n2. Thus third row of the\nT.M. is\n \n0, 1\n2, 1\n2\n \n.

Then he remains in that state forever. He\ndoes not play again. Thus the state a0 is an absorbing\nstate, no money (and he does not transit from this\nstate to any other state).\nLast row: Similarly if he has Rs. 600 (i.e., his original\nRs. 300 and winning amount of Rs. 300) he stops the\n\nJOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND MARKOV CHAINS\n31.17\ngameandremainsinthestate(hedoesnotplay).Thus\nthe state a6 is also an absorbing state, all money.\nSecond row: Suppose he has Rs. 100 i.e., he is in state\na1. Then the probability that he will lose Rs. 100 is\n3\n4 and therefore transfers to a0 state (no money). But\nhe can not transfer to states a2, a3, a5, a6. But by\nwinning Rs. 200 with probability 1\n4 he can have Rs.\n300 (Rs. 100 original + Rs. 200 winning). Thus the\nprobability of going from state a1 to a3 is 1\n4, and from\na1 to a0 is 3\n4. Thus the probability vector (second row)\nis\n 3\n4 0 0 1\n4 0 0 0\n \n.\nThird row: Starting with Rs. 200 (a2 state) he can\nlose Rs. 100 with probability 3\n4 thereby go to state\na1 or win Rs. 200 with probability 1\n4, thereby go to\nstate a4. Thus third row\n \n0 3\n4 0 0 1\n4 0 0\n \n.\nSimilarly, other rows of P are obtained.\n(b) The initial probability distribution is\np(0) = (0 0 0 1 0 0 0)\nbecause he has started the game with an initial\namount of Rs. 300 and is therefore in state a3. To \ufb01nd\nthe probability that the game has at least 4 plays, we\ncompute p(4), which gives the probability distribu-\ntion of the system after 4 steps (i.e., 4 games).

In majority of the\ncases, the solutions to these problems in analytical\nform are non-existent or dif\ufb01cult or not amenable for\ndirect interpretation. In all such problems, Numerical\nAnalysis provides approximate solutions, practical\nand amenable for analysis. Numerical analysis does\nnot strive for exactness. Instead, it yields approxi-\nmations with speci\ufb01ed degree of accuracy. The early\ndisadvantage of the several number of computations\ninvolved has been removed through high speed com-\nputation using computers, giving results which are\naccurate, reliable and fast. Numerical analysis is not\nonly a science but also an \u2018art\u2019 because the choice of\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 procedure which \u2018best\u2019 suits to a given\nproblem yields \u2018good\u2019 solutions.\nIn this chapter we consider the bisection, reg-\nula falsi and Newton-Raphson\u2019s methods of obtain-\ning solutions of transcendental equations. For an\nunknown function f (x) given at a set of tabulated\nvalues, interpolation is the process of obtaining a\nsimpler function \u03c6(x). We study Newton-Gregory\n\ufb01nite differences formulae. Sterling and Bessel\u2019s\ncentral differences for equally spaced value of x.\nLagrange\u2019s interpolation and inverse interpolation\nis used for arbitrarily spaced x.

We study trapezoidal, Simp-\nson\u2019s 1\n3, 3\n8 rule, Weddle\u2019s and Boole\u2019s rules of inte-\ngration. Quadratic and cubic splines which are pow-\nerful tools in piecewise-polynomial approximation\nare also considerd.\n32.1\nROOTS OF TRANSCENDENTAL\nEQUATIONS\nAn algebraic equation of degree n is\nP (x) \u2261a0xn + a1xn\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + an = 0\n(1)\nwhere the coef\ufb01cients a0, a1, . . . , an are real num-\nbers and a0  = 0. Here n \u22651. Transcendental equa-\ntions are non-algebraic equations involving transcen-\ndental functions such as exponential, logarithmic,\ntrigonometric or hyperbolic functions. A general\nform of an algebraic or transcendental equation is\nf (x) = 0\n(2)\nwhere the function f (x) is de\ufb01ned and continuous\non an interval a < x < b.\n32.1\n\n32.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VIII\nRoot\nAny value \u03be for which f (\u03be) = 0 is known as the\nroot or solution of the equation (2) or \u03be is called the\nzero of the function f (x). In the case of the alge-\nbraic Equation (1), the roots can be determined in\nanalytical (literal) form when n = 1, 2, 3, 4 (i.e., for\nlinear, quadratic, cubic and biquadratic equations).\nFor n \u22655 no such results exists for the roots of (1).\nAlso from the fundamental theorem of algebra, (1)\nhasexactlynroots,realorcomplexwhereasthenum-\nber and analytical form of roots of a transcendental\nequation are not known at all.\nExample:\nsin x = 2 has no real roots, sin x = 1\n2\nhas in\ufb01nite number of roots, while sin x = x\n2 has\nthree real roots (see Fig. 32.9 on page 32.6).\nTherefore only approximate solutions (roots) of\nan algebraic or transcendental Equation (2) are to be\nfound by numerical methods consisting of (a) isolat-\ning the roots (b) and then improving the value of the\napproximate roots. Here it is assumed that the roots\nof (2) are isolated i.e., for any root \u03be of (2) there\nexists an interval containing no other root except \u03be.\nGeometrically, the root of Equation (2) is the point\nwhere the graph (or curve) of y = f (x) crosses the\nx-axis (i.e., y = f (x) = 0). Although the roots can\nbe isolated by drawing the graphs of the curve, these\ngraphical methods are cumbersome. The following\ntheorem is very useful in isolating the roots of (2).\nTheorem 1:\nIf a continuous function f (x)\nassumes values of opposite sign at the end points\nof an interval [\u03b1, \u03b2] i.e., f (\u03b1)f (\u03b2) < 0, then the\ninterval will contain at least one root of the equa-\ntion f (x) = 0 i.e., there exists \u03be \u2208(\u03b1, \u03b2) such that\nf (\u03be) = 0.\nNote 1:\nRoot \u03be will be unique (only one) in the\ninterval (\u03b1, \u03b2) if f  (x) has the same sign in the inter-\nval (\u03b1, \u03b2) (i.e., f  > 0 or f  < 0 in \u03b1 < x < \u03b2).\nNote 2:\nFor an nth degree algebraic Equation (1),\nwe get (n + 1) sign changes.\nNote 3:\nDescarte\u2019s rule of sign: The number of pos-\nitive roots of f (x) = 0 can not exceed the number of\nFig. 32.1\nFig. 32.2\nFig. 32.3\nchanges of sign in f (x). Also the number of negative\nroots of f (x) can not exceed the number of changes\nof sign in f (\u2212x).\nExample:\nf (x) = x5 \u22126x2 \u22124x + 5 = 0.\nf (x) : + \u2212\u2212+ : 2 changes of sign; no more than 2\npositive roots.\nf (\u2212x) : \u2212\u2212++: one change of sign; no more than\none negative root.\nBisection Method (or Halving Method or\nBolzano Method)\nConsider the equation\nf (x) = 0\n(2)\nin [a, b]. Assume that f (a)f (b) < 0. The bisection\nmethod isolates the root in [a, b] by halving process,\napproximately dividing the given interval [a, b] into\ntwo, four, eight etc. equal parts. Thus in order to\n\ufb01nd a root of (2) lying in the interval [a, b], divide\n\nNUMERICAL ANALYSIS\n32.3\nthe interval in half. If f\n a+b\n2\n \n= 0, then \u03be = a+b\n2\nis\nthe required root. If f\n a+b\n2\n \n = 0, then choose that\nhalf\n \na, a+b\n2\n \nor\n a+b\n2 , b\n \n, at the end points of which\nf (x) has opposite signs. The newly reduced inter-\nval [a, b] is again bisected and the above process is\nrepeated. Thus we get a sequence of nested intervals\n[a1, b1], [a2, b2], . . . , [an, bn] such that\nf (an)f (bn) < 0\nfor\nn = 1, 2, . . .\nand\nbn \u2212an = 1\n2n (b \u2212a).\nThe required root \u03be = 1\n2(an + bn).\nRugula-Falsi Method (or Method of False\nPosition or Linear Interpolation or Method of\nChords or Method of Proportional Parts)\nThis method is probably the oldest, faster method\nmore generally applicable.\nFig. 32.4\nTo \ufb01nd root \u03be of the equation f (x) = 0 in the\ninterval [a, b] assume that f (a) < 0 and f (b) > 0\nso that f (a) \u00b7 f (b) < 0.\nGeometrically, this method is equivalent to replac-\ningthecurvey = f (x)byachordthatpassesthrough\nthe points A(a, f (a)) and B(b, f (b)).

From the recorded data of (ti, Ai), time\nand altitude of a rocket, a physicist would like to\nestimate what was the altitude at a particular time\nt0( = ti). Thus most of the experimental or observed\ndata is in the form a set of say (n + 1) ordered pairs\n(x0, y0), (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) which is the tabular\nform of an unknown function y = f (x). The pro-\ncess of determining the value of y for an x \u2208[x0, xn]\nis known as interpolation. Here x0, x1, . . . , xn are\n\nNUMERICAL ANALYSIS\n32.13\ncalled interpolation (or mesh) points. Note that x\ndiffers from the interpolation points. Thus interpo-\nlation is the \u201cart of reading between the lines of a\ntable.\u201d In extrapolation value of y is determined for\nan x /\u2208[x0, xn] i.e., for x outside the interval [x0, xn].\nBut generally interpoaltion includes extrapolation\nalso.\nThe problem of interpolation is to construct a\nnew (interpolating) function F(x) which collocates\n(coincides) with the unknown function f (x) at the\ntabulated (n + 1) interpolation points\nFig. 32.10\ni.e.,\ny0 \u2261f (x0) = F(x0),\ny1 \u2261f (x1) = F(x1), . . .\nyn \u2261f (xn) = F(xn).\nGeometrically, this means that graphs of y = f (x)\nand y = F(x) coincide at the n + 1 points. Since a\nunique straight line passes through two given points,\na unique parabola through three given points, a\nunique polynomial F(x) of degree n can be deter-\nmined (passing) satisfying the given set of (n +\n1) points. In this case it is called a polynomial\ninterpolation. Now from y = F(x), y can be com-\nputed for a given x.

Similarly, the Newton-Gregory\nbackward difference formula used one-sided values\n\u2207yn, \u22072yn, \u22073yn which lie on one side of yn. Inter-\npolation formulae that contain both preceding and\nsucceeding values of the funtion w.r.t., the initial\nvalue, give very useful results. For this purpose, the\ndifferences located in a horizontal row (line) corre-\nsponding to the initial values x0 and y0 in a diag-\nonal difference table are used. These are known as\ncentral differences and are used in the Gauss, Stir-\nling and Bessel interpolation formulae, for interpo-\nTable 32.7: Central differences table\nlation near the middle of the table, taken as the\ninitial value.

Lemma: If y = P(x) is an nth degree polyno-\nmial, then its divided difference of nth order\nis constant. Consequently, the (n + 1)th order\ndivided differences is zero i.e.,\n[x, x0, . . . , xn\u22121] = c = constant and\n[x, x0, . . . , xn\u22121, xn] = c \u2212c\nx \u2212xn\n= 0\nwhich follows from the fact that\n[x, x0] = P(x) \u2212P(x0)\nx \u2212x0\nis a polynomial of degree (n \u22121) in x, and\n[x, x0, x1] = p(x, x0) \u2212p(x0, x1)\n(x \u2212x1)\nis a polynomial of degree (n \u22122) in x, and so on.\nThus [x, x0, x1, . . . , xn, xn\u22121] is a polynomial of\ndegree (n \u2212n) i.e., zero degree in x.\nNote:\nOrder of any divided difference is one less\nthan the number of values of the argument in it i.e.,\n3rd order differences contain four values of x.\n32.10\nNEWTON\u2019S DIVIDED DIFFERENCES\nFORMULA\nWhen another interpolation point is added to the tab-\nulated data, the Lagrangian coef\ufb01cients are to be\nrecalculated, resulting a different Lagrange\u2019s poly-\nnomial of higher degree.

Interpolating\ncurve is a curve that passes through a set of points in\na plane and the curve is said to interpolate at these\npoints.\nIt is observed that approximation of arbitrary func-\ntions on a closed interval becomes oscillatory for\nhigher-degree polynomials. By dividing the given\ninterval into a collection of subintervals, piecewise\npolynomial approximation consists of constructing\na (generally) different approximating polynomial on\neach subinterval. Cubic spline interplation is the\nmost common piecewise approximation using cubic\npolynomial, known as spline function, connecting\neach pair of data points (or nodes or knots). Cubic\nsplines are third-order curves employed to connect\neach pair of data points.\nConsider a set of (n + 1) data points, which\nneed not be evenly spaced, (x0, f (x0)), (x1, f (x1)),\n(x2, f (x2)) . . . (xn, f (xn))\nor\n(xi, fi) for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n.\n(1)\nBetween each pair of adjacent points from xi to\nxi+1, we \ufb01t an nth degree polynomial si(x). Thus\nthe spline (function) curve can be of any degree. By\nfar, cubic splines are the most popular and are useful\nversion in engineering practice since the cubic spline\ninterpolation gives an interpolation formula that is\nsmooth in the \ufb01rst derivative and continuous, both\nwithin an interval and its boundaries (end points x0\nand xn). The name \u2018spline\u2019 is originated from the\ndraftman\u2019ssplinewhichisa draftingaidconsistingof\na thin \ufb02exible rod or strip of wood that is bent to draw\na smooth curve through the points to be interpolated.\nLinear Splines\nLinear splines are \ufb01rst-order splines de\ufb01ned by lin-\near functions. Geometrically they are straight lines\nconnecting two adjacent data points. For a given set\nof (n + 1) data points (1), the set of linear functions\nde\ufb01ning linear splines in the \u2018n\u2019 intervals are:\nS1(x) = f (x0) + m0(x \u2212x0); x0 \u2264x \u2264x1.\nS2(x) = f (x1) + m1(x \u2212x1); x1 \u2264x \u2264x2.\n\n32.48\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VIII\nx0\nx1\nx2\nxn \u2013 1 xn\nS(x)\nx\nFig. 32.15 Piecewise linear interpolation\n............................................................\nSn(x) = f (xn \u22121) + mn\u22121(x \u2212xn\u22121);\nxn\u22121 \u2264x \u2264xn\nHere mi is the slope of the straight line connecting\nthe data points (or nodes) xi and xi+1 and is given by\nmi = f (xi+1) \u2212f (xi)\nxi+1 \u2212xi\n(2)\nFitting of linear splines is piecewise linear inter-\npolation and the interpolating curve is broken curve\njoining \u2018n\u2019 straight line segments. Disadvantage of\nlinear splines is that at the point (known as knot)\nwhere two splines meet, the slope changes abruptly\ni.e., \ufb01rst derivative is discontinuous.\nQuadratic Splines\nInterpolation of second-order polynomials leads to\nquadratic splines having continuous \ufb01rst derivatives\nat the knots.\nFor each interval we \ufb01t a parabola given by\nsi(x) = aix2 + bix + ci\nFor n + 1 data points we have n intervals. So we\nshould determine 3 \u00d7 n unknown constants (a\u2019s, b\u2019s\nand c\u2019s). The 3n condition to \ufb01nd the 3n unknowns\nare given by the following equations.\n1. At the interior knots, the function values must\nbe equal.\nai\u22121x2\ni\u22121 + bi\u22121xi\u22121 + ci\u22121 = f (xi\u22121)\naix2\ni\u22121 + bixi\u22121 + ci = f (xi\u22121)\nfor i = 2, n giving raise to 2(n \u22121) = 2n \u22122\nconditions.\n2. The \ufb01rst and last functions must pass through\nthe two end points x0 and xn.\na1x2\n0 + b1x0 + c1 = f (x0)\nanx2\nn + bnxn + cn = f (xn)\ngiving 2 conditions.\n3. At the interior knots, the \ufb01rst derivatives\nf  (x) = 2ax + b must be equal.\n2ai\u22121xi + bi\u22121 = 2aixi + bi\nfor i = 2 to n giving n \u22121 conditions\n4. Assume that the second derivative is zero at\nthe \ufb01rst point x0. Then the \ufb01rst two points are\nconnected by a straight line, so a1 = 0.\nThus solving (2n \u22122) + 2 + (n \u22121) +\n1 = 3n conditions above we get the 3n\nunknown constants a, b, c\u2019s. The drawback is\nthe straight line connecting the \ufb01rst two points.\nCubic Splines\nA spline of at least (m + 1) order should be used in\norder to make sure that the mth derivatives are con-\ntinuous at knots. Cubic splines employing third order\npolynomials are very popular in practice because\nthey ensure that the \ufb01rst and second derivatives are\ncontinuous.\nf x\n(\n)\n0\nf x\n(\n)\n1\nf x\n(\n)\n2\nf x\n(\n)\n3\nS x\n1( )\nS x\n2( )\nS x\n3( )\nInterval 1 2nd interval\n3rd\ninterval\nx\ni\n0\n= 0\nx\ni\n1\n= 1\nx\ni\n2\n= 2\nx\ni\n3\n= 3\nx\nS x\n( )\nFig. 32.16 Piecewise cubic spline approximation\nLet us \ufb01t a (different) third order polynomial\nSi(x) = aix3 + bix2 + cix + di\n(3)\nfor each of the n intervals between the (n + 1)\ndata points (knots) (i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n).

The\nadvantage is that numerical solutions can be obtained\nfor problems involving irregularly shaped bound-\naries and is easy to program on computer. The only\nserious disadvantage with these numerical solutions\nis that they lack the generality of the analytical solu-\ntions.

Substituting these values in (3), y(x)\nat any point can be calculated from (3), provided\nh = x \u2212x0 is small.\nWhen x0 = 0, then Taylor\u2019s series (3) takes sim-\npler form\ny(x)=y(0)+y (0) \u00b7 x+y  (0) \u00b7 x2\n2! + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +y(n)\n(0) \u00b7 xn\nn! + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(4)\n33.1\n\n33.2\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VIII\nModi\ufb01ed Euler\u2019s Method\nFor small changes  x in x, the change in y is  y \u2248\ndy\ndx  x.

The most popular predictor-corrector meth-\nods are probabily the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton\nschemes, which have good stability properties unlike\nthe Milne\u2019s method which is unstable due to the cor-\nrector. The predictor-corrector method consists of\nthree separate processes. The predictor step P, eval-\nuation of derivative y \nn+1 from the latest value of y,\ncall as E and the corrector step, call as C. Iterating\nm times with the corrector in this notation, may be\nwritten as P(EC)m.

Although\nanalytical solutions can be obtained by separation of\nvariable technique and integral transforms (Fourier\n\n33.12\nHIGHER ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\u2014VIII\ntransforms), in many complicated cases one has to\nresort to numerical methods. Initial value problems\nor time dependent problems consists of two types:\nhyperbolic problems (containing both fxx and ftt\nterm as in wave equation) and parabolic problems\n(which contain only fxx and ft but no ftt term as in\nthe heat equation). For these problems, the solution is\nknown at an initial time and then propagates through\nspace in time. The domain is open (goes to in\ufb01n-\nity) somewhere for example, in time. The other type\nof problems is the boundary value problem where\nthe domain is closed and is entirely surrounded by\nboundary values. These problems are called elliptic\n(and are time independent as in the case of Laplace\nequation).\nThe dimension of a partial differential equation\nis the number of space variables x, y, z appear-\ning in the equation as independent variables (apart\nfrom the independent variable time t). Thus a one-\ndimensional heat equation or one-dimensional wave\nequation involves only one space variable say x (and\nof course time t). Similarly two-dimensional Laplace\nequation contains two space variables say x and y.\nThe central idea in numerical methods to partial\ndifferential equations is to discretize the partial dif-\nferentialequationbyreplacingit,approximately,bya\n\ufb01nite system of algebraic equations. One such impor-\ntant discretization method is \ufb01nite differences, in\nwhich the derivatives are replaced by \ufb01nite differ-\nences. The entire given domain is discretized by a\ndiscrete set of points, as follows:\nIntroducing xi = x0 + ih, i = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13,\n. . . and tj = t0 + jk, j = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, . . ., the\n(numerical) solution is obtained at the discrete points\n(xi,tj) known as grid or nodal or lattice or mesh or\npivotal points of the computational grid. Here h =\nconstant is spacing (or size of interval) in x-direction\nwhile k = constant is spacing in t-direction.\n33.5\nNUMERICAL SOLUTION TO ONE-\nDIMENSIONAL HEAT EQUATION\nConsider the initial boundary value problem of the\nparabolic one-dimensional heat equation.\nP.D.E:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t = c2 \u22022u\n\u2202x2 , 0 \u2264x \u2264L, t \u22650\n(1)\nTwo boundary conditions (B.C.\u2019s):\nu(0, t) = 0\nu(L, t) = 0\n(2)\nOne initial condition (I.C.)\nu(x, 0) = f (x)\n(3)\nFig. 33.3\nReplacing ut and uxx by \ufb01nite differences, equa-\ntion (1) is approximated by a \ufb01nite difference equa-\ntion.\n1\nk\n \nui,j+1 \u2212uij\n \n= c2\nh2\n \nui+1,j \u22122uij + ui\u22121,j\n \n(4)\nHere h is mesh size in x-direction i.e., h = L\nN and\nk is mesh size in t-direction. Rewriting (4),\nui,j+1 =\n \n1 \u22122r)uij + r(ui+1,j + ui\u22121,j\n \n(5)\nwhere r = c2k\nh2 . This method is known as Schmidt\nexplicitmethodbecausetheunknownui,j+1 isexplic-\nitly expressed in terms of the known (given) values\nui,j; ui+1,j; ui\u22121,j; whereas in the implicit method\nsuch as the Crank-Nicolson method the equations are\nimplicit i.e., coupled and one has to solve a system\nof linear equations. Formula (5) provides a march-\ning scheme to compute u at the mesh points. This\nmethod is convergent and stable if r = c2k\nh2 \u22641\n2. In\nparticular for r = 1\n2, (5) reduces to\nui,j+1 = 1\n2(ui+1,j + ui\u22121,j)\n(6)\nwhich is known as Bender-Schmidt recurrence rela-\ntion.

These m \u00b7 n numbers are known\nas the elements or entries of the matrix A and are\nenclosed in brackets [ ], or ( ) or || ||. The order of the\nmatrix is m \u00d7 n.\nWhen m  = n, the matrix is said to be rectangular.\nRow matrix (or row vector) B1\u00d7n is a matrix having\nonly one row (and several columns), column matrix\n(or column vector) Cm\u00d71 is a matrix having only one\ncolumn (and several rows). A matrix is said to be a\nn-square matrix or simply square matrix if m = n.\nThus the number of rows and number of columns in\na square matrix are equal.\nThe elements of the matrix A are denoted by aij\nand are located by the double subscript notation ij\nwhere the \ufb01rst subscript i denotes the row (position)\nand the second subscript j denotes the column posi-\ntion. Thus capital letters are used to denote matrices,\nwhile the corresponding small letters with double\nsubscript notation are used to denote the elements\n(or entries). Thus A = [aij].\nNull or zero matrix denoted by 0 is a matrix with\nall its elements zero.\nEquality: Two matrices A and B are said to be equal\nif they are of the same order and aij = bij for every\ni and j. Otherwise they are unequal, denoted by\nA  = B.\n34.2\nMATRIX ALGEBRA\nSum (or difference): Cm\u00d7n = Am\u00d7n \u00b1 Bm\u00d7n then C\nis said to be the sum (or difference) of A and B pro-\nvided cij = aij \u00b1 bij for i, j i.e. the elements of C\nare obtained by adding (or subtracting) the corre-\nsponding elements of A and B.\nNote that addition or subtraction of matrices A and\nB is possible only when both A and B are of the same\norder.\nSubmatrix of A is a matrix obtained from A after\ndeleting some rows or columns or both.\nScalar multiplication: For any non zero scalar k,\nwe have C = kA when cij = kaij i.e every element\nof A is multiplied by k. Thus \u2212B is considered as B\nmultiplied by \u22121.\nProperties:\n1. A + B = B + A\ncommutative\n2. A + (B \u00b1 C) = (A + B) \u00b1 C\nassociative\n3. k(A + B) = kA + kB\ndistributive\n4. A \u2212B  = B \u2212A\nnot commutative\nTranspose of a matrix A of order m \u00d7 n is denoted\nby AT or A is obtained from A by interchanging the\nrows and columns. Thus B = AT is of n \u00d7 m order\nand bji = aij for any i, j, i.e. the i, j th element of A\nis placed in the j, ith location in AT .\nProperties:\n1. (AT )T = A\n2. (kA)T = kAT\n3. (A + B)T = AT + BT\n34.1\n\n34.2\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nMatrix multiplication: Two matrices A and B are\nsaid to be conformable for multiplication if the num-\nber of columns in A is equal to the number of rows\nin B. Then the product of two matrices Am\u00d7p and\nBp\u00d7n is a matrix cm\u00d7n where\ncij =\np \nk=1\naikbkj\nfor i = 1 to m and\nj = 1 to n\ni.e., i, j th element in the product matrix C is obtained\nby adding the p products obtained by multiplying\neach entry of the ith row of A by the corresponding\nentry of the j th column of B. Thus matrix multipli-\ncation amounts to multiplication of rows (of the \ufb01rst\nmatrix) into columns (of the second matrix) i.e., row\nby column multiplication.\nm A\n\u2022 p B\n= m C\nn\nn\np\ni.e. mn scalar products of the\nm rows of A with n columns of B.\nIn the product C = AB, the matrix B is premul-\ntiplied or multiplied from the left by A; while the\nmatrix A is post multiplied or multiplied from the\nright by B.\nProperties:\n1. (kA)B = k(AB) = A(kB) = kAB\n2. A(BC) = (AB)C\n3. (A + B)C = AC + BC\n4. A(B + C) = AB + AC\nHowever\n5. AB  = BA in general (not commutative)\n6. AB = 0 does not necessarily imply that A = 0 or\nB = 0 or BA = 0.\nAlso\n7. AB = AC\ndoes not necessarily imply that\nB = C, even when A  = 0.\n8. (AB)T = BT AT\ni.e., transpose of a product is the product of the trans-\nposes.\n34.3\nSPECIAL SQUARE MATRICES\nThe elements aii of an n-square matrix are known\nas diagonal elements. Trace of matrix A =\ntrace of A =\nn \ni=1\naii = sum of the diagonal elements.\nResult: trace (A + B) = trace A + trace B,\ntrace (kA) = k trace A.\nA is singular matrix if |A| = 0. A is Non-singular\nmatrix if |A|  = 0\nUpper triangular matrix if aij = 0 for i > j i.e.,\ncan have non zero entries only on and above the main\ndiagonal while any entry below the diagonal is zero.\nLower triangular matrix if aij = 0 for i < j. A\nmatrix is said to be triangular if it is either upper or\nlower triangular matrix.\nDiagonal matrix if any entry above or below, the\nmain diagonal is zero. However zero entries may be\npresent in the diagonal. Thus\naij = 0 for i  = j\n(however aii = 0, not for all i).\nScalar matrix is a diagonal matrix in which all the\ndiagonal entries are equal to a constant k i.e., aii = k\nfor every i and aij = 0 for any i and j, (i  = j).\nIdentity matrix denoted by I is a scalar matrix with\nk = 1.

A\ndeterminant is a scalar (numerical value) associated\nwith only square matrix A = [aij] and is denoted as\ndeterminant of A or det A or |A|. Thus a determinant\nis a scalar-valued function whose domain is a set of\nsquare matrices. A determinant of an n \u00d7 n square\nmatrix A is a scalar given by\nD = det A =\n         \na11 a12 . . . a1n\na21 a22 . . . a2n\n...\nan1 an2 . . . ann\n         \n(1)\nThe determinant D is said to be of order n and con-\ntains n2 elements or quantities (which may be num-\nbers or functions), arranged in n rows and n columns.\n\nMATRICES AND DETERMINANTS\n34.7\nThe principal diagonal of the determinant is the slop-\ning line of elements from left top corner a11 to ann.\nNote that in the matrix representation the elements\naij are enclosed between brackets [ ] or ( ) or || ||,\nwhereas in the determinant the elements are enclosed\nbetween vertical lines or bars | |. For n = 2, the second\norder determinant is de\ufb01ned by\nD = detA =\n    \na11 a12\na21\na2\n    = a11 a22 \u2212a21 a12. (2)\ni.e. second order determinant = difference between\nthe product of elements of principal diagonal and the\nproduct of the elements of the other diagonal.\nFor n = 1,\nD = det[a11] = [a11] = a11\nNote:\nHere vertical bars does not denote absolute\nvalue. Thus det [\u22125] = | \u22125| = \u22125\nMinor of an element aij of a matrix A, denoted by\nMij, is an (n \u22121) order determinant of the submatrix\nof A obtained by omitting the ith row and jth column\nin A.\nCofactor of an element aij of a matrix A, denoted\nby Cij, is a signed minor of aij\ni.e.\nCij = (\u22121)i+jMij\nLaplace Expansion\nLaplace Expansion is the expansion of determinant\nin terms of the cofactors. For n \u22652\nD =\nn\n \nj=1\naij Cij = ai1 Ci1 + ai2 Ci2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ainCin\n(row wise for any i = 1, 2, . . . or n)\n(3)\nor\nD =\nn \ni=1\naij Cij =a1j C1j +a2j C2j +\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+anjCnj (4)\n(column wise for any j = 1, 2, . . . or n).\nThus the value of a determinant is the sum of the\nproducts of elements of any row (or column) and\ntheir respective cofactors. However sum of products\nformed by multiplying the elements of a row (or col-\numn) of A by the corresponding cofactors of another\nrow (or column) of A is zero i.e.\nn \nk=1\naik Cjk = \u03b4ij|A|\nor\nn \nk=1\nakj Cki = \u03b4ij|A|. Here \u03b4ij is the Kronecker\ndelta. So it is convenient to choose the row or column\nin the determinant with zeros in it, since these terms\nin the expansion will vanish. The expansion of D by\n(3) or (4) involves n! determinants since D is de\ufb01ned\nin terms of n determinants of order (n \u22121), each of\nwhich is in turn de\ufb01ned in terms of (n \u22121) determi-\nnants of order (n \u22122) and then (n \u22122) determinants\nof order (n \u22123) and so on. As the number of calcula-\ntions of an nth order determinant is N(n) \u223cen!, even\nfor n = 25, computing time is 4 \u00d7 1019 sec s  1012\nyears. However with the use of several properties of\ndeterminants which are listed below, the determinant\ncan be triangularized. In this case, the number of cal-\nculations N(n) \u223c2n3\n3 . For n = 25, computation time\nis 0.01 second (against 1012 years which is incredi-\nble!)\nProperties of Determinants\n1. If all the elements of any one row (or column) are\nzero, then det A = 0.\n2. If any two rows (or columns) are proportional to\neach other, then det A = 0.\n3. If any row (or column) is a linear combination of\nother rows (or columns), then det A = 0.\n4. If all the elements of any row or column are mul-\ntiplied by k, giving rise to a new matrix B, then\ndet B = k \u00b7 det A.\n5. If B = kA then det B = det (kA) = kn det A.\n6. det (AT ) = det (A).\n7. In\ngeneral,\ndet\n(\u03b1A + \u03b2B)  = \u03b1 det (A) +\n\u03b2 det (B) i.e. determinant ( ) is not linear.\n8. If any two rows (or columns) of A are inter-\nchanged, yielding a new matrix B then\ndet B = \u2212det A.\n9. If k times the elements of any row (or column) in\nA are added to the corresponding elements of any\nrow (or column) in A, giving rise to a new matrix\nB, then det B = det A. This operation is written\nsymbolically as\n\n34.8\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nri \u2192ri + k rj\ni.e., elements of jth row multiplied by k are added\nto the corresponding elements of the ith row. Here\nthe ith row gets modi\ufb01ed. Similarly\nci \u2192ci + k cj\n10. If A is a (upper or lower) triangular matrix or\ndiagonal matrix then\ndet A = a11 \u00b7 a22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ann\ni.e. value of the determinant is the product of the\ndiagonal elements.\n11. If each element of a row (or column) consists of\n\u2018m\u2019 terms (two: binomials, three: trinomial etc),\nthen the determinant is expressed as the sum of\n\u2018m\u2019 determinants. Suppose any row (or column)\nof A is a binomial say a = b + c then\ndet A|a = det A|b + det A|c .\nHere A|a is the original matrix, A|b is the matrix\nobtained from the original matrix A|a by replacing\na by b and similarly A|c by replacing a by c.\nExtending this, if the elements of say three rows\n(or columns) consists of m, n, p terms respectively\nthen the original determinants can be expressed as\nthe sum of m \u00b7 n \u00b7 p determinants as stated above.\nProduct of Determinants\n12. For any n \u00d7 n matrices A and B\ndet (AB) = det (BA) = det A \u00b7 det B\nNote:\nIf A is singular, then AB is also singular so\ndet A = 0, det AB = 0. Thus 0 = 0\n13. If C = det A \u00b7 det B, then the i, jth element of C\nis obtained by multiplying the ith row (or column)\nof A with jth column (or row) of B. Note that in\nmatrix multiplication i, jth element is obtained\nby multiplying the ith row of A with jth column\nof B. Whereas in determinant multiplication, ijth\nelement is obtained either by multiplying (ith row\nof A with jth column of B) or (ith row of A with\njth row of B) or (ith column of A with jth column\nofB)or(ithcolumnofAwithjthrowofB).Thus,\nin determinant multiplication we can multiply row\nby row, row by column, column by row or column\nby column.\n14. Derivative of a Determinant\nIf the elements aij of a matrix A are differentiable\nfunctions of a parameter t, then the derivative of\nthe determinant A equals to sum of n determinants\nobtained by replacing in all possible ways the ele-\nments of one row (or column) of |A| by their deriva-\ntives wrt \u2018t\u2019, i.e.\nd\ndt (det A) =\n         \nda11\ndt \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 da1n\ndt\na21 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a2n\n...\nan1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ann\n         \n+\n         \na11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a1n\nda21\ndt \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 da2n\ndt\n...\nan1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ann\n         \n+\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\n         \na11\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\na1n\n...\nan\u22121, 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an+1, n\ndan1\ndt\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\ndann\ndt\n         \n15. Factor Theorem\nConsider an nth order functional determinant A in\nwhich the elements aij are functions of x. Suppose\nfor x = x\u2217, any two rows (or columns) of A become\nequal, then det A = 0. Then det A must contain\na factor (x \u2212x\u2217). Suppose for x = x\u2217, k rows (or\ncolumns) become identical then det A = 0. So con-\nsequently det A must contain a factor (x \u2212x\u2217)k\u22121.\n16. Singular\nA matrix A is said to be singular if |A| = 0, otherwise\nA is said to be nonsingular i.e., determinant of A is\nnon zero (|A|  = 0).\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nFind all the cofactors and evaluate\nA =\n    \n\u22122 3\n\u22124 5\n    \nSolution:\nC11 = cofactor of \u22122 = 5,\nC12 = cofactor of 3 = 4,\nC21 = cofactor of \u22124 = \u22123,\n\nMATRICES AND DETERMINANTS\n34.9\nC22 = cofactor of 5 = \u22122\nBy Laplace expansion about the \ufb01rst row,\n|A| = \u22122 \u00b7 C11 + 3 \u00b7 C12 = \u22122(5) + 3(4)\n= \u221210 + 12 = 2\nBy Laplace expansion about the second row\n|A| = \u22124 C21 + 5 C22 = \u22124 (\u22123) + 5 (\u22122)\n= 12 \u221210 = 2\nSimilarly about \ufb01rst column\n|A| = (\u22122)(5) \u22124(\u22123) = \u221210 + 12 = 2\nAbout 2nd column, |A| = 3(+4) + 5(\u22122) = 2\nExample 2:\nFind the minors M21, M13, cofactors\nC22, C32 and evaluate the determinant\n|A| =\n      \n12 27 12\n28 18 24\n70 15 40\n      \nSolution:\nM21 = minor of 28 =\n    \n27 12\n15 40\n    \n= 1080 \u2212180 = 900\nM13 = Minor of 12 =\n    \n28 18\n70 15\n    = \u2212840\nC22 = cofactor of 18 = (\u22121)2+2M22 =\n    \n12 12\n70 40\n    \n= \u2212360\nC32 = cofactor of 15 = (\u22121)3+2M32 = \u2212\n    \n12 12\n28 24\n    \n= \u2212(\u221248) = 48.

The unit square in the \ufb01gure\ncan be expressed as an in\ufb01nite (geometric) series\n1 = 1\n2 + 1\n4 + 1\n8 + 1\n16 + 1\n32 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nSeveral functions can be expressed as \u201cin\ufb01nite\npolynomials\u201d (known as \u201cpower series\u201d) using\nthe concept of in\ufb01nite series. By Fourier series,\ncertain functions can be represented as an in\ufb01nite\nsum of trigonometric functions. Using in\ufb01nite\nseries, differential equations in problems of signal\ntransmission, chemical diffusion, vibration and heat\n\ufb02ow can be solved and non elementary integrals\nevaluated. The in\ufb01nite process of summing of an\nin\ufb01nite series is a puzzle for centuries convergence\nand divergence of in\ufb01nite series plays an important\nrole in engineering applications.\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n8\n1\n16\n35.1\nSEQUENCES\nA sequence is a function from the domain set of\nnatural numbers N to any set S.\nReal sequence\nis a function from N to R,\nthe set of real numbers; denoted by f : N \u2192R.\nThus the real sequence f is set of all ordered\npairs {n, f (n)}|{n = 1, 2, 3, . . .} i.e., set of all pairs\n(n, f (n)) with n a positive integer.\nNotation:\nSincethedomainofasequenceisalways\nthe same (the set of positive integers) a sequence may\nbe written as {f (n)} instead of {n, f (n)}.\nExamples:\n1.\n \nn, 1\nn\n \n=\n 1\nn\n \n=\n \n1, 1\n2, 1\n3, 1\n4, . . . 1\nn . . .\n \n2.\n \nn,\n1\n2n\u22121\n \n=\n \n1\n2n\u22121\n \n=\n \n1, 1\n2, 1\n22 , 1\n23 , 1\n24 , . . . ,\n1\n2n\u22121 , . . .\n \nconstant sequence where range is singleton set {c},\nc = constant.\nExample:\n{3, 3, 3, 3, . . .}\nNull sequence {0, 0, 0, . . . , 0, . . .}\nA sequence is also denoted by {an} whose ordinate\ny = an at the abscissa x = n.

The\nnumbers u1, u2, u3, . . . un are known as the \ufb01rst,\nsecond, third,. . ., nth term of the series (1).\nIn\ufb01nite Series\nIf the number of terms in the series (1) is in\ufb01nite, then\nthe series is called an in\ufb01nite series (otherwise \ufb01nite\nseries when the number of terms is \ufb01nite).

If a series  un converges to a sum s then the\nseries c  un also converges to the sum cs, where\nc is a constant.\n2. If the series  un and  vn converges to the sums\ns and s  respectively then the series  (un + vn)\nand  (un \u2212vn) also converge to s + s  and\ns \u2013s  respectively. Addition or subtraction of two\nseries is done by termwise addition or termwise\nsubtraction.\n3. The convergence of a series is not affected by\nthe suppression (deletion) or addition of a \ufb01nite\nnumber of its terms, since the deletion or addition\nof the sum of these \ufb01nite number of terms (which\nis a \ufb01nite quantity) does not alter the behaviour\nof the sum of the series.\n35.5\nNECESSARY CONDITION\nFOR CONVERGENCE\nNecessary condition for convergence of a series\n un is that, its nth term un approaches zero as n\nbecomes in\ufb01nite i.e.,\nIf series converges,\nthen lim\nn\u2192\u221eun = 0.\nImportant Note: This is not a test for convergence.\nProof:\nLet s be the sum of this convergent series.\nAlso let Sn and Sn\u22121 be the nth and (n \u22121)th partial\nsums of the given series so that\nun = Sn \u2212Sn\u22121\nTaking limit, we have\nlim\nn\u2192\u221eun = lim\nn\u2192\u221e(Sn \u2212Sn\u22121) = lim\nn\u2192\u221eSn \u2212lim\nn\u2192\u221eSn\u22121\n= s \u2212s = 0.\nNote 1:\nThe converse of the above result is not\ntrue, i.e., the above result is not a suf\ufb01cient condition.\nFrom the fact that the nth term un approaches zero,\n\nSEQUENCES AND SERIES\n35.5\nit does not follow that the series converges, for the\nseries may diverge.\nIf lim\nn\u2192\u221eun = 0, then the series may converge or\nmay diverge.\nExample:\n1 + 1\n2 + 1\n3 + 1\n4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 1\nn + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 is a di-\nvergent series although its nth term approaches zero\ni.e.,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221eun = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn = 0\nNote 2:\nPreliminary test for divergence.\nIf the nth term of a series does not tend to zero as\nn \u2192\u221e, then the series diverges i.e.,\nif lim\nn\u2192\u221eun  = 0 then series diverges.\nExample:\n1\n2 + 2\n3 + 3\n4 + 4\n5 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\nn\nn + 1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nSince\nlim\nn\u2192\u221eun = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\nn+1 = 1  = 0 by the above\npreliminary test, the given series diverges.\n35.6\nSTANDARD INFINITE SERIES:\nGEOMETRIC SERIES AND\nHARMONIC SERIES\nGeometric Series Test\n\u221e\n \nn=0\narn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + arn\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nwith\na  = 0\n(1)\nis a geometric series, whose terms form a geometric\nprogression with the \ufb01rst term a and the common\nratio r.

Hence\nS2m > 0 and increases with increasing m as more\npositive values are added. Rewriting (4) as\nS2m = u1 \u2212(u2 \u2212u3) \u2212(u4 \u2212u5) \u2212\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2212(u2m\u22122 \u2212u2m\u22121) \u2212u2m\nand again using the condition (2), note that\nS2m < u1\nsince positive quantities (in each bracket) are sub-\ntracted from u1.

An in\ufb01nite sequence {an} is convergent, diver-\ngent or oscillates \ufb01nitely (or in\ufb01nitely) accord-\ning as the limit an as n \u2192\u221eis \ufb01nite, in\ufb01nite,\nor not unique (\u00b1\u221e).\n2. If an in\ufb01nite series is convergent then neces-\nsarily its nth term approaches zero as n \u2192\u221e,\nalthough the converse is not true i.e., when\nlim\nn\u2192\u221eun = 0, the series may converge or diverge,\nso further investigation is required. However,\nwhen lim\nn\u2192\u221eun  = 0, the series is divergent.\n3. Given an in\ufb01nite series, classify it as (a) series\nof positive terms (b) alternating series (c) plus\nand minus series (d) power series.\n4. For positive series, check whether lim\nn\u2192\u221eun = 0.\nIf so, compare it with the standard geometric se-\nries  arn or p-harmonic series  1\nnp where\np = difference between the degree of the nu-\nmerator and denominators of un.\n5. Otherwise try ratio test. When ratio test fails,\napply Raabe\u2019s or Logarithmic or DeMorgan\u2019s\nand Bertrand\u2019s tests.\n6. Prefer Cauchy\u2019s nth root test when un involves\nnth powers of itself as a whole.\n7. Integral test is used when the terms of the series\nare positive and non-increasing and the evalua-\ntion of the integral is easy.\n8. Use Leibnitz\u2019s theorem to test for convergence\nof an alternating series.\n9. In a plus- and -minus series (includes alternating\nseries) if the series of absolute terms converges\nthen the series is absolutely convergent and is\ntherefore also (ordinarily) convergent. If not i.e.,\nwhen the series of absolute terms diverges and\noriginal series is convergent then series is con-\nditionally convergent.\n10. Use ratio test, to \ufb01nd the interval of convergence\nof a power series. Examine the series at the end\npoints of the interval also.\n\nChapter36\nAnalytical Solid Geometry\n36.1\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1637, Rene Descartes* represented geometrical\n\ufb01gures (con\ufb01gurations) by equations and vice versa.\nAnalytical Geometry involves algebraic or analytic\nmethods in geometry. Analytical geometry in three\ndimensions also known as Analytical solid** geom-\netry or solid analytical geometry, studies geometrical\nobjects in space involving three dimensions, which\nis an extension of coordinate geometry in plane (two\ndimensions).\nFig. 36.1\n* Rene Descartes (1596\u20131650) French philosopher and mathe-\nmatician, latinized name for Renatus Cartesius.\n** Not used in the sense of \u201cnon-hollowness\u201d. By a sphere or\ncylinder we mean a hollow sphere or cylinder.\nRectangular Cartesian Coordinates\nThe position (location) of a point in space can be\ndetermined in terms of its perpendicular distances\n(known as rectangular cartesian coordinates or sim-\nply rectangular coordinates) from three mutually\nperpendicular planes (known as coordinate planes).\nThe lines of intersection of these three coordinate\nplanes are known as coordinate axes and their point\nof intersection the origin.\nThe three axes called x-axis, y-axis and z-axis are\nmarked positive on one side of the origin. The pos-\nitive sides of axes OX, OY, OZ form a right handed\nsystem. The coordinate planes divide entire space\ninto eight parts called octants. Thus a point P with\ncoordinates x, y, z is denoted as P (x, y, z). Here\nx, y, z are respectively the perpendicular distances\nof P from the YZ, ZX and XY planes. Note that a line\nperpendicular to a plane is perpendicular to every\nline in the plane.\nDistance between two points P1(x1, y1, z1) and\nP2(x2, y2, z2) is\n\u0001\n(x2\u2212x1)2+(y2\u2212y1)2+(z2\u2212z1)2.\nDistance from origin O(0, 0, 0) is\n\u0002\nx2\n2 + y2\n2 + z2\n2.\nDivisions of the line joining two points P1, P2:\nThe coordinates of Q(x, y, z), the point on P1P2\ndividing the line segment P1P2\nin the ratio\nm : n are\n\u0003 nx1+mx2\nm+n\n, ny1+my2\nm+n , nz1+mz2\nm+n\n\u0004\nor putting\nk for m\nn ,\n\u0005\nx1+kx2\n1+k , y1+ky2\n1+k , z1+kz2\n1+k\n\u0006\n; k  = \u22121. Coordi-\nnates of mid point are\n\u0003 x1+x2\n2\n, y1+y2\n2\n, z1+z2\n2\n\u0004\n.\n36.1\n\n36.2\nENGINEERING MATHEMATICS\nDirection of a line: A line in space is said to be\ndirected if it is taken in a de\ufb01nite sense from one\nextreme (end) to the other (end).\nAngle between Two Lines\nTwo straight lines in space may or may not intersect.\nIf they intersect, they form a plane and are said to\nbe coplanar. If they do not intersect, they are called\nskew lines.\nAngle between two intersecting (coplanar) lines is\nthe angle between their positive directions.\nAngle\nbetween\ntwo\nnon-intersecting\n(non-\ncoplanar or skew) lines is the angle between two in-\ntersecting lines whose directions are same as those\nof given two lines.\n36.2\nDIRECTION COSINES AND\nDIRECTION RATIOS\nDirection Cosines of a Line\nLet L be a directed line OP from the origin O(0, 0, 0)\nto a point P (x, y, z) and of length r (Fig. 36.2).\nSuppose OP makes angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 with the positive\ndirections of the coordinate axes. Then \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are\nknown as the direction angles of L. The cosines of\nthese angles cos \u03b1, cos \u03b2, cos \u03b3 are known as the di-\nrection cosines of the line L(OP ) and are in general\ndenoted by l, m, n respectively.\nThus\nl = cos \u03b1 = x\nr ,\nm = cos \u03b2 = y\nr ,\nn = cos \u03b3 = z\nr .\nwhere\nr =\n\u0002\nx2 + y2 + z2.\nFig. 36.2\nCorollary 1:\nLagrange\u2019s identity: l2+m2+n2 = 1\ni.e., sum of the squares of the direction cosines of\nany line is one, since l2 + m2 + n2 = cos2 \u03b1 +\ncos2 \u03b2 + cos2 \u03b3 = x2\nr2 + y2\nr2 + z2\nr2 = 1.\nCorollary 2:\nDirection cosines of the coordinate\naxes OX, OY, OZ are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)\nrespectively.\nCorollary 3:\nThe coordinates of P are (lr, mr, nr)\nwhere l, m, n are the direction cosines of OP and r\nis the length of OP.\nNote:\nDirection cosines is abbreviated as DC\u2019s.\nDirection Ratios\n(abbreviated as DR\u2019s:) of a line L are any set\nof three numbers a, b, c which are proportional\nto l, m, n the DC\u2019s of the line L. DR\u2019s are also\nknown as direction numbers of L. Thus\nl\na = m\nb =\nn\nc = k (proportionality constant) or l = ak, m = bk,\nn = ck. Since l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 or (ak)2 + (bk)2 +\n(ck)2 = 1 or k =\n\u00b11\n\u221a\na2+b2+c2 . Then the actual di-\nrection cosines are cos \u03b1 = l = ak = \u00b1\na\n\u221a\na2+b2+c2 ,\ncos \u03b2=m = bk = \u00b1\nb\n\u221a\na2+b2+c2 , cos \u03b3 = m = ck =\n\u00b1\nc\n\u221a\na2+b2+c2 with a2 + b2 + c2  = 0. Here +ve sign\ncorresponds to positive direction and \u2212ve sign to\nnegative direction.\nNote 1:\nSum of the squares of DR\u2019s need not be\none.\nNote 2:\nDirection of line is [a, b, c] where a, b, c\nare DR\u2019s.\nDirection cosines of the line joining two points\nP1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2):\nl = cos \u03b1 = PQ\nr\n= LM\nr\n= OM \u2212OL\nr\n= x2 \u2212x1\nr\n.\nSimilarly, m = cos \u03b2 = y2\u2212y1\nr\nand n = cos \u03b3 =\nz2\u2212z1\nr\n.

The present day problems include\nthe maximization of the entropy integral in third law\nof thermodynamics, minimization of potential and\nkinetic energies integral in Hamilton\u2019s principle in\nmechanics, the minimization of energy integral in\nthe problems in elastic behaviour of beams, plates\nand shells. Thus calculus of variations deals with the\nstudy of extrema of \u201cfunctionals\u201d.\nFunctional:\nA real valued function f\nwhose\ndomain is the set of real functions {y(x)} is known\nas a functional (or functional of a single independent\nvariable). Thus the domain of de\ufb01nition of a func-\ntional is a set of admissible functions. In ordinary\nfunctions the values of the independent variables are\nnumbers. Whereas with functionals, the values of the\nindependent variables are functions.\nExample:\nThe length L of a curve, c whose equa-\ntion is y = f (x), passing through two given points\nA(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) is given by\nL =\n x2\nx1\n \n1 + y 2dx\nwhere y denotes derivative of y w.r.t. x.\nNow the length L of the curve passing through\nA and B depends on y(x) (the curve). Than L is a\nfunction of the independent variable y(x), which is\na function. Thus\nL{y(x)} =\n x2\nx1\n \n1 + y 2dx\nFig. 37.1\nde\ufb01nes a functional which associates a real number\nL uniquely to each y(x) (the independent variable).\nFurther suppose we wish to determine the curve hav-\ning shortest (least) distance between the two given\npoints A and B, i.e., curve with minimum length L.\nThis is a classical example of a variational problem\nin which we wish to determine, the particular curve\ny = y(x) which minimizes the functional L{y(x)}\ngiven by (1). Here the two conditions y(x1) = y1 and\ny(x2) = y2, which are imposed on the curve y(x) are\nknown as end conditions of the problem. Thus varia-\ntional problems involves determination of maximum\nor minimum or stationary values of a functional. The\nterm extremum is used to include maximum or min-\nimum or stationary values.\n37.2\nVARIATIONAL PROBLEM\nConsider the general integral (a functional)\nI{y(x)} =\n x2\nx1\nf (x, y, y )dx\n(1)\n37.1\n\n37.2\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nExtremal: A function y = y(x) which extremizes\n(1) and satis\ufb01es the end conditions y(x1) = y1 and\ny(x2) = y2 is known as an extremal or extremizing\nfunction of the functional I (given by (1)). A\nvariational problem is to \ufb01nd such an extremal\nfunction y(x).\nVariation of a Function and a Functional\nWhen the independent variable x changes to x +  x\nthen the dependent variable y of the function y =\nf (x) changes to y +  y. Thus  y is the change of\nthe function, the differential dy provides the varia-\ntion in y. Consider a function f (x, y, y ) which for\na \ufb01xed x, becomes a functional de\ufb01ned on a set of\nfunctions {y(x)}.\nFor a \ufb01xed value of x, if y(x) is changed to y(x) +\n \u03b7(x), where  is independent of x, then  \u03b7(x) is\nknown as the variation of y and is denotd by \u03b4y.\nSimilarly, variation of y is  \u03b7 (x) and is denoted by\n\u03b4y .

The objective may\nbe to maximize the pro\ufb01t or to minimize the cost.\nThe variables may be products, man-hours, money\nor even machine hours. Optimal allocation of lim-\nited resources to achieve a given object forms pro-\ngramming problems. A programming problem in\nwhich all the relations between the variables is lin-\near including the function to be optimized is called a\nLinear Programming Problem (LPP). G.B. Dantzig,\nin 1947, \ufb01rst developed and applied general problem\nof linear programming. Classical examples include\ntransportation problem, activity-analysis problem,\ndiet problems and network problem. The simplex\nmethod, developed by GB Dantzig, in 1947, con-\ntinues to be the most ef\ufb01cient and popular method to\nsolve general LPP. Karmarkar\u2019s method developed\nin 1984 has been found to be upto 50 times as fast as\nthe simplex algorithm. LPP is credited to the works\nof Kuhn, Tucker, Koopmans, Kantorovich, Charnes\nCooper, Hitchcock, Stiegler. LPP has been used to\nsolve problems in banking, education, distribution\nof goods, approximation theory, forestry, transporta-\ntion and petroleum.\n38.2\nFORMULATION OF LPP\nIn a linear programming problem (LPP) we wish to\ndetermine a set of variables known as decision vari-\nables. This is done with the objective of maximiz-\ning or minimizing a linear function of these vari-\nables, known as objective function, subject to certain\nlinear inequality or equality constraints. These vari-\nables, should also satisfy the nonnegativity restric-\ntions since these physical quantities can not be neg-\native. Here linearity is characterized by proportion-\nality and additivity properties.\nLet x1, x2 . . . , xn be the n decision unknown vari-\nables and c1, c2 . . . , cn be the associated (constant\ncost) coef\ufb01cients. Then the aim of LP is to optimize\n(extremise) the linear function,\nz = c1x1 + c2x2 + . . . + cnxn\n(1)\nHere (1) is known as the objective function. (O.F.)\nThe variables xj are subject to the following m linear\nconstraints\nai1x1 + ai2x2 + . . . + ainxn\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\u2265\n\u2264\n\u2265\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8febi\n(2)\nfor i = 1, 2, ... m. In (2), for each constraint only one\nof the signs \u2265or \u2264or = holds. Finally xi should also\nsatisfy nonnegativity restrictions\nxj \u22650 for j = 1 to n\n(3)\nThus a general linear programming problem consists\nof an objective function (1) to be extremized subject\nto the constraints (2) satisfying the non-negativity\nrestrictions (3).\n38.1\n\n38.2\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nSolution\nTo LPP is any set of values {x1, x2 . . . , xn} which\nsatis\ufb01es all the m constraints (2).\nFeasible Solution\nTo LPP is any solution which would satisfy the non\nnegativity restrictions given by (3).\nOptimal Feasible Solution\nTo LPP is any feasible solution which optimizes (i.e.\nmaximizes or minimizes) the objective function (1).\nFrom among the in\ufb01nite number of feasible solu-\ntions to an LPP, we should \ufb01nd the optimal feasible\nsolution in which the maximum (or minimum) value\nof z is \ufb01nite.\nExample 1:\nSuppose Ajanta clock company pro-\nduces two types of clocks \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cdeluxe\u201d\nusing three different inputs A, B, C. From the data\ngivenbelowformulatetheLPPtodeterminethenum-\nber of standard and deluxe clock to be manufactured\nto maximize the pro\ufb01t.\nLet x1 and x2 be the number of \u201cstandard\u201d and\n\u201cdeluxe\u201d clocks to be produced.\nTechnical coefficients\nInput\nStandard\nDeluxe\nCapacity\n(Resource)\nA\nB\nC\n2\n2\n4\n2\n4\n2\n0\n3\n20\n12\n16\nC\nProfit (Rs)\nThen the objective function is to maximize the\ntotal pro\ufb01t i.e. maximize z = 2x1 + 3x2, since the\npro\ufb01t for one standard clock is Rs 2 and pro\ufb01t for\none deluxe and clock is Rs 3. Because of the limited\nresources, for input A we have the following restric-\ntion. Since one standard clock consumes 2 units of\nresource A, x1 units of standard clocks consume 2x1\nunits of input A. Similarly 4x2 units of input A is\nrequired to produce x2 deluxe clocks. Thus the total\nrequirement of the input A for production of x1, stan-\ndard and x2 deluxe clocks is\n2x1 + 4x2.\nHowever, the total amount of resource A available is\n20 units only. Therefore the restriction on resource\nA is\n2x1 + 4x2 \u226420\nSimilarly the restriction of resource B is\n2x1 + 2x2 \u226412\nand restriction on source C is\n4x1 \u226416.\nSince x1, x2 are physical quantities (the number of\nclocks produced), they must be non negative i.e.\nx1 \u22650\nand\nx2 \u22650.\nThus the LPP consists of the O.F., three inequality\nconstraints and the non-negativity restrictions.\n38.3\nGRAPHICAL SOLUTION OF LPP\nWhen the number of decision variables (or products)\nis two, the solution to linear programming problem\ninvolving any number of constraints can be obtained\ngraphically. Consider the \ufb01rst quadrant of the x1x2\nplane since the two variables x1 and x2 should sat-\nisfy the nonnegativity restrictions x1 \u22650 and x2 \u22650.\nNow the basic feasible solution space is obtained in\nthe \ufb01rst quadrant by plotting all the given constraints\nas follows. For a given inequality, the equation with\nequality sign (replacing the inequality) represents a\nstraight line in x1x2 plane dividing it into two open\nhalf spaces. By a test reference point, the correct side\nof the inequality is identi\ufb01ed. Say choosing origin\n(0, 0) as a reference point, if the inequality is satis-\n\ufb01ed then the correct side of the inequality is the side\non which the origin (0, 0) lies. Indicate this by an\narrow. When all the inequalities are plotted like this,\nin general, we get a bounded (or unbounded in case\nof greater than inequalities) polygon which enclose\nthe feasible solution space, any point of which is a\nfeasible solution.\nForz = z0,theobjectivefunctionz = c1x1 + c2x2\nrepresents an iso-contribution (or iso-pro\ufb01t) straight\nline say x2 = \u2212c1\nc2 x1 + z0\nc2\n \nor x1 = \u2212c2\nc1 x2 + z\nc1\n \n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING\n38.3\nsuch that for any point on this line, the contribu-\ntion (Pro\ufb01t) (value of z0) is same. To determine the\noptimal solution, in the maximization case, assign-\ning arbitrary values to z, move the iso-contribution\nline in the increasing direction of z without leav-\ning the feasible region. The optimum solution occurs\nat a corner (extreme) point of the feasible region.\nSo the iso-pro\ufb01t line attains its maximum value of\nz and passes through this corner point. If the iso-\ncontribution line (objective function) coincides with\none of the edges of the polygon, then any point on\nthis edge gives optimal solution with the same max-\nimum (unique) value of the objective function. Such\na case is known as multiple (alternative) optima case.\nIn the minimization case, assigning arbitrary values\nto z, move the iso-contribution line in the direction\nof decreasing z until it passes through a corner point\n(or coincides with an edge of the polygon) in which\ncase the minimum is attained at this corner point.\nRange of Optimality\nForagivenobjectivefunctionz = c1x1 + c2x2,slope\nof z changes as the coef\ufb01cients c1 and c2 change\nwhich may result in the change of the optimal corner\npoint itself. In order to keep (maintain) the current\noptimum solution valid, we can determine the range\nof optimality for the ratio c1\nc2\n \nor c2\nc1\n \nby restricting the\nvariations for both c1 and c2.\nSpecial Cases:\n(a) The feasible region is unbounded and in the case\nof maximization, has an unbounded solution or\nbounded solution.\n(b) Feasible region reduces to a single point which\nitself is the optimal solution. Such a trivial solu-\ntion is of no interest since this can be neither max-\nimized nor minimized.\n(c) A feasible region satisfying all the constraints is\nnot possible since the constraints are inconsistent.\n(d) LPP is ill-posed if the non-negativity restriction\nare not satis\ufb01ed although all the remaining con-\nstraints are satis\ufb01ed.\nExamples:\n(a) x1+3x2 \u22653, x1+x2 \u22652, x1, x2 \u22650,\nMaximize: z = 1.5x1 + 2.5x2 unbounded feasi-\nble region, unbounded solution (can be maxi-\nmized inde\ufb01nitely)\nFig. 38.1\n(b) x1\u2212x2 \u22650, \u22120.5x1+x2 \u22641 x1, x2 \u22650\nMaximize: z = x2 \u22120.75x1 unbounded feasible\nregion z2 = 0.5 is bounded optimal solution.\nFig. 38.2\n(c) x1 + x2 \u22642, \u2212x1, \u22125x2 \u2264\u221210\nMaximize: z = \u22125x2, x1, x2 \u22650, (0, 2) is unique\nsolution, max: z = \u221210.\n(0, 2)\nFig. 38.3\n(d) x1 + x2 \u22641, \u22120.5x1 \u22125x2 \u2264\u221210\nMaximize: z = \u22125x2, x1, x2 \u22650.

Thus, the following analysis\ncan be applied for a maximization or minimization\nproblem without any loss of generality.\nCanonical form of LPP is an LPP given by (1) (2)\n(3) with all the constraints (2) are of the less than or\nequal to type.\nStandard form of LPP consists of (1) (2) (3) with all\nconstraints (2) are of the equality type and with all\nbi \u22650, for i = 1 to m.\nConversion to Standard Form Given any general\nLPP, it can be transformed to standard LPP as fol-\nlows:\n1. In any constraint if the right hand side con-\nstant bi is negative, then multiply that constraint\nthroughout by \u22121. (Note that multiplication of an\ninequality constraint by \u22121, reverses, the inequal-\nity sign i.e. \u22123 < \u22122, multiplied by \u22121 we get\n(\u22121)(\u22123) > (\u22121)(\u22122)or3 > 2.\n2.

For small n and m, all the basic solutions (cor-\nner points) can be enumerated (listed out) and the\noptimal basic feasible solution can be determined.\nExample:\nMaximize: z = 2x1 + 3x2 s.t. 2x1 + x2 \u22644, x1 +\n2x2 \u22645.

It is proved that\nthe set of feasible solutions to a LPP form a convex\nset (the line joining any two points of the set lies in\nthe set) and the corner (extreme) points of the convex\nset are basic feasible solutions. If there is an optimal\nsolution, it exists at one of these corner points. The\nsimplex method devised by GB Dantzig is a power-\nful procedure which investigates in a systematic way\nfor optimal solution at these corner points which are\n\ufb01nite in number.\nFor m = 10, n = 20, simplex method obtains the\noptimal in 15 steps, thus having an advantage of\n92,378 to 1.\n38.5\nSIMPLEX METHOD\nThe simplex method is an algebraic iterative pro-\ncedure which solves any LPP exactly (not approxi-\nmately) or gives an indication of an unbounded solu-\ntion.

When all the z-\nrow coef\ufb01cients of the non basic variables are non-\nnegative (nonpositive) then the current solution is\noptimal.\nFeasibility condition\nIn both the maximization and minimization prob-\nlems, the basic variable associated with the smallest\nnonnegative ratio (with strictly positive denomina-\ntor) will be the leaving variable.\n\n38.10\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nThus the simplex method can be summarized as\nfollows:\nStep 0. If all the constraints are less than or equal\nto type, introduce slack variables and determine the\nstarting basic solution.\nStep I. Using optimality condition, select the enter-\ning variable. If no variable can enter the basis, stop.\nThe current solution is optimal.\nStep II. Using feasibility condition determine the\nleaving variable.\nStep III. Compute the new basic solution (new sim-\nplex tableau) and go to step I.\nArti\ufb01cial Variable Technique\nFor a LPP in which all the constraints are less than or\nequal to type with bi \u22650, an all-slack, initial basic\nfeasible solution readily exists. However for prob-\nlems involving \u2265inequalities or equality constrains\nno such solution is possible. To alleviate this, arti\ufb01-\ncial variables are introduced in each of the \u2265or =\ntype constraints, and slack variables for the less than\nor equal to type which will then provide a starting\nsolution. The M-method and the two-phase method\nare two closely related methods involving arti\ufb01cial\nvariables.\nM-Method (also Known as Charne\u2019s Method\nor Big M-Method)\nSince arti\ufb01cial variables are undesirable, the coef\ufb01-\ncient for the arti\ufb01cial variable in the objective func-\ntion is taken as \u2212M in maximization problem and\nas + M in minimization problems. Here M is a very\nlarge positive (penalty) value. The augmented prob-\nlem is solved by simplex method, resulting in one of\nthe following cases:\n1. When all the arti\ufb01cial variables have left the basis\nand optimality condition is satis\ufb01ed, then the cur-\nrent solution is optimal.\n2. When one or more arti\ufb01cial variables are present\nin the basis at zero level and the optimality condi-\ntion is satis\ufb01ed, then the solution is optimal with\nsome redundant constraints\n3. No feasible solution exists when one or more arti-\n\ufb01cial variables are present in the basis at a positive\nlevel although the optimality condition is satis-\n\ufb01ed. Such a solution is known as pseudo optimal\nsolution since it satis\ufb01es the constraints but does\nnot optimize the objective function.\nNote:\nSince arti\ufb01cial variables which is forced out\nof the basis, is never considered for reentry, the col-\numn corresponding to the arti\ufb01cial variable may be\nomitted from the next simplex tableau.\nTwo-Phase Method\nIn the M-method, M must be assigned some speci\ufb01c\nnumerical value which creates trouble of roundoff\nerrors especially in computer calculations. The z-\ncoef\ufb01cient of the arti\ufb01cial variable will be of the form\naM + b. For large chosen M, b may be lost and for\nsmall chosen M and small a, b may be present leading\nto incorrect results. The two phase method consists\nof two phases and alleviates the dif\ufb01culty in the M-\nmethod.\nPhase I\nExactly as in M-method, introduce necessary arti\ufb01-\ncial variables to get an initial basic feasible solution.\nSolve this augmented problem, by simplex method\nto minimize r, the sum of the arti\ufb01cial variables. If\nr = 0, then all the arti\ufb01cial variables are forced out\nof the basis. Goto phase II. If r > 0, indicating the\npresence of arti\ufb01cial variables at non zero level, LP\nhas no feasible solution\nPhase II\nThe feasible solution of phase I forms the initial basic\nfeasible solution to the original problem (without any\narti\ufb01cial variables). Apply simplex method to obtain\nthe optimal solution.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nEnumeration\nExample 1:\nSolve the following LPP by enumerat-\ning all basic feasible solutions.

Here the\nvalue of OF is 0 since all the resources are unutilized.\nIn the z-row, the value of the objective function in the\nsolution column is enclosed in a square. Since this is\na maximization problem, to improve (increase) the\nvalue of z, one of the non-basic variables will enter\ninto the basis and there by forcing out one of the\ncurrent basic variable from the basis (since the num-\nber of basic variables in the basis is \ufb01xed and equals\nto m = 3 the number of constraints). From the opti-\nmality condition, the entering variable is one with\nthe most negative coef\ufb01cient in the z-row. In the z-\nrow the most negative elements is \u22123.

It is one of the earliest\nand most useful application of linear programming\nproblem. It is credited to Hitchcock, Koopmans and\nKantorovich. The transportation model consists of\ntransporting (or shipping) a homogeneous product\nfrom \u2018m\u2019 sources (or origins) to \u2018n\u2019 destinations, with\nthe objective of minimizing the total cost of trans-\nportation, while satisfying the supply and demand\nlimits.\nLet ai denote the amount of supply at the ith\nsource, bj denote the demand at destination j; cij\ndenote the cost of transportation per unit from ith\nsource to jth destination; xij the amount shipped\nfrom origin i to destination j. Then the transportation\nproblem is to minimize the total cost of transporta-\ntion\nz =\nm\n \ni=1\nn\n \nj=1\ncijxij\n(1)\nsubject to the constraints\nsource constraint :\nn\n \nj=1\nxij = ai,\nai > 0; i = 1, 2, . . . m\n(2)\nDestination constraint:\nm\n \ni=1\nxij = bj, bj > 0; j = 1, 2, . . . , n\n(3)\nand\nxij \u22650\n(4)\nIn the balanced transportation problem it is assumed\nthat the total quantity required at the destinations is\nprecisely the same as the amount available at the\norigins i.e.\nm\n \ni=1\nai =\nn\n \nj=1\nbj.\n(5)\n(5) is the necessary and suf\ufb01cient condition for the\nexistance of a feasible solution to (2) and (3).\nDenoting the sources and destinations as nodes\nand routes as arcs, the transportation problem can be\nrepresented as a network shown below:\nSm\nDn\nS1\nD1\nb1\na1\nb2\na2\nbn\nam\nS2\nD2\nDemand\nDestinations\nSources\nSupply\nc\nx\n11\n11\n;\nc\nx\nmn\nmn\n;\nThe system of equations (1) to (4) is a linear pro-\ngramming problem with m + n equations in mn vari-\nables. The transportation problem always has a \ufb01nite\nminimum feasible solution and an optimal solution\ncontains m + n \u22121 positive xij\u2019s when there are m\norigins and n destinations. It is degenerate if less than\nm + n \u22121 of the xij\u2019s are positive. No transportation\nproblem has ever been known to cycle.\nTable for Transportation Problem\nS1\nS2\nSi\nSm\nbj\na\na\n1\n2\nai\nam\nbn\nbj\nb2\nb1\nS\n=\nai\nS bj\nc1n\nc1j\nc12\nc11\ncmn\ncmj\ncm2\ncm1\nx1n\nx1j\nx12\nx11\nxmn\nxmj\nxm2\nxm1\nu\nu\nai\nDn\nDj\nD2\nD1\nu\nu\nDestinations\nSources\nNote:\nZero values for nonbasic variables are not\n\ufb01lled while zero values for basic variables are shown\nin the tableau.\nLike the simplex method the transport algorithm\nconsists of determining the initial basic feasible solu-\ntion, identifying the entering variable by the use of\noptimality condition and \ufb01nally locating the leaving\nvariable by the use of feasibility condition.\n\n38.20\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nDetermination of Initial (starting) Basic Fea-\nsible Solution\nAn initial basic feasible solution containing m + n \u2212\n1 basic variables can be obtained by any one of the\nfollowing methods (a) the north west corner rule\n(b) row minimum (c) column minimum (d) matrix\nminimum (or least cost method) (e) Vogel approx-\nimation method. In general, Vogel\u2019s method gives\nthe best starting solution. Although computationally\nnorth west corner rule is simple, the basic feasible\nsolution obtained by this method may be far from\noptimal since the costs are completely ignored.\n(a) North-west corner rule (due to Dantzig):\nStep I: Allocate as much as possible to the north west\ncorner cell (1, 1). Thus let x11 = min(a1, b1). If a1 \u2264\nb1 then x11 = a1 and all x1j = 0 for j = 2, 3, . . . n\ni.e. except x11 all other elements of the \ufb01rst row are\nzero. The \ufb01rst row is satis\ufb01ed so cross out the \ufb01rst\nrow and move to x21 of second row.\nIf a1 \u2265b1 then x11 = b1 and all xi1 = 0 for i =\n2, 3, . . . m i.e., except x11 all other elements in the\n\ufb01rst column are zero. The \ufb01rst column is satis\ufb01ed\nso cross out the \ufb01rst column and move to x12 of the\nsecond column.\nNote:\nIf both a row and column are satis\ufb01ed (i.e.,\nsay x11 = a1 = b1) simultaneously, then cross out\neither row or column only but not both row and col-\numn.\nStep II: Allocating as much as possible to the cell\n(2, 1) or (1, 2) cross out the row or column and move\nto (3, 1) or (1, 3).\nStep III: If exactly one row or column is left\nuncrossed out, stop. Otherwise go to step II wherein\nmove to lower row (below) if a row has just been\ncrossed out or move to right column if a column has\njust been crossed out.\nNote: Cells from \u201ccrossed out\u201d row or column can\nnot be chosen for basis cells at a later step in the\ndetermination of starting basic solution.\n(b) Row-minimum\nIdentify the minimum cost element c1k in the \ufb01rst\nrow. (Ties are broken arbitrarily). Allocate as much\nas possible to cell (1, k). If a1 \u2264bk then x1k = a1 so\nmove to the second row after changing bk to bk \u2212a1.\nIdentify the minimum element in second row and\nallocate as much as possible. Continue this process\nuntil all rows are exhausted. If a1 > bk then x11 = bk,\nchange a1 to a1 \u2212bk, and identify the next smallest\n(minimum) element in the \ufb01rst row allocate, continue\nthe process until the \ufb01rst row is completely satis\ufb01ed.\n(c) Column-minimum\nThis is exact parallel to the above row-minimum\nmethod except that minimum in the columns are\nidenti\ufb01ed instead of rows.\n(d) Matrix minimum (least-cost method):\nIdentify the least (minimum) element cij in the\nentire matrix. (Ties are broken arbitrarily). Allocate\nas much as possible to the (i, j)th cell. If ai \u2264bj\nthen xij = ai, change bj to bj \u2212ai. If ai \u2265bj then\nxij = bj, change ai to ai \u2212bj. Identify the next least\nelement and allocate as much as possible. Continue\nthis process until all the elements in the matrix are\nallocated (satis\ufb01ed).\n(e) Vogel approximation method\nStep I. The row penalty for a row is obtained by sub-\ntracting the smallest cost element in that row from\nthe next smallest cost element in the same row. Cal-\nculate the row penalties for each row and similarly\ncolumn penalties for each column.\nStep II. Identify the row or column with the largest\npenalty (ties are broken arbitrarily). In the selected\nrow or column, allocate as much as possible to the\ncellwiththeleastunitcost.Crossoutthesatis\ufb01edrow\nor column. If a row and column are satis\ufb01ed simul-\ntaneously, cross out either a row or column but not\nboth. Assign zero supply (or demand) to the remain-\ning row (or column). Any row or column with zero\nsupply or demand should not be used in computing\nfuture penalties.\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING\n38.21\nStep III.\n(a) A starting solution is obtained when exactly one\nrow or one column with zero supply or demand\nremains uncrossed out. Stop.\n(b) Determine the basic variables in an uncrossed\nrow (column) with positive (non zero) supply\n(demand) by the least-cost method. Stop.\n(c) Determine the zero basic variables in all the\nuncrossed out rows and columns having zero sup-\nply and demand by the least cost method. Stop.\n(d) Otherwise, go to step 1, recalculate the row and\ncolumn penalties and go to step II.\nNote:\nVogel\u2019s method, which is a generalization of\nthe matrix minimum (least cost method) gives better\nsolution in most cases than all the other methods\nlisted above.\nMethod of Multipliers\nThe optimal solution to the transportation prob-\nlem is obtained by iterative computions using the\nmethod of multipliers (also known as UV -method\nor stepping-stone method or MODI (modi\ufb01ed distri-\nbution) method). First of all, obtain a starting initial\nbasic feasible solution containing m + n \u22121 basic\nvariables (by any one of the above methods).\nStepI:Introduceunknowns ui withrow i andvj with\ncolumn j such that for each current basic variable xij\nin the tableau,\nui + vj = cij\nis satis\ufb01ed. This results in m + n equations in m + n\nunknowns. Assume that u1 = 1 (or u1 = 0). (Instead\nof u1, any other variable ui or vj can be chosen as\nzero or one, resulting in the same optimal solution\nbut with different values in the tableau). Solving the\nequations in ui, vj we get ui for i = 1 to m and vj\nfor j = 1 to n.\nStep II. For each non basic variable, compute\ncij = ui + vj \u2212cij\nStep III: (a) If cij \u22640 for any i and j (i.e. for all\nnon basic variables), stop. The current tableau gives\nthe optimal solution with minimum cost.\n(b) If cij > 0, then solution is to be revised. The\nentering variable is one which has most positive cij\n(i.e., max cij for all i and j).\n(c) The leaving variable is determined by con-\nstructing a closed \u03b8-loop which starts and ends at the\nentering variable and consists of connected horizon-\ntal and vertical lines (without any diagonals). Thus\neach corner of the loop lies in the basic cell, except\nthe starting cell. The unknown \u03b8 is subtracted and\nadded alternatively at the successive corners so as\nto adjust the supply and demand. From the cells in\nwhich \u03b8 is subtracted, choose the maximum value\nof \u03b8 such that xij \u2212\u03b8 \u22650. This feasibility condition\ndetermines the leaving variable. Now go to step I.\nMaximization A transportation problem in which\nthe objective is to maximize (the pro\ufb01t) can be trans-\nfered to a minimization problem by subtracting all\nthe entries of the cost matrix from the largest entry\nof the matrix.\nUnbalanced problem in which the total supply is\nnot equal to the total demand can always be trans-\nfered to a balanced transportation problem by aug-\nmenting it with a dummy source or dummy destina-\ntion. A dummy destination is added when supply is\ngreater than the demand. The cost of transportation\nfrom any source to this dummy destination is taken\nas zero. Similarly when demand is greater than sup-\nply, a dummy source is added. The cost of shipping\nfrom this dummy source to any destination is taken\nas zero. Now the corresponding balanced problem is\nsolved by the method of multipliers.\nTranshipment problem consists of transporting\nfrom source to destination via (through) intermedi-\nate or transient nodes, known as transhipment nodes\nwhich act as both sources and destination. The tran-\nshipment node should be large enough to allow the\nentire supply or demand to pass through it. Thus\nthe \u2018capacity\u2019 of the transient node is the \u2018buffer\u2019\namount which equal the total supply or demand.\nThus the transhipment model consists of pure sup-\nply nodes which tranship the original supply, pure\ndemand nodes which receive the original demand,\nand transhipment node which can receive original\nsupply plus the buffer or can tranship the original\ndemand plus the buffer. A given transhipment prob-\n\n38.22\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nlem can be transformed to a regular transportation\nproblem as follows:\nI. Identify the pure supply nodes, pure demand\nnodes and transhipment nodes from the given net-\nwork.\nII. Denote the pure supply nodes and transhipment\nnodes as the sources.\nIII. Denote the pure demand nodes and transhipment\nnodes as the destinations.\nIV. Note down the transportation costs cij read from\nthe given network. If ith source is not connected to\njth destination, put cij = M where M is a large\n(penalty) value. Take cii = 0 since it costs zero\nfor transporting from ith source to itself (ith des-\ntination).\nV. Identify supply at a pure supply node as the origi-\nnal supply; demand at a pure demand node as the\noriginal demand; supply at a transhipment node as\nthe sum of original supply and buffer and \ufb01nally\ndemand at a transhipment node as the sum of the\noriginal demand and buffer.\nNow the above transformed regular transportation\nproblem can be solved by using the method of mul-\ntipliers.\nDegeneracy\nThe solution of a transport problem\nis said to be degenerate when the number of basic\nvariables in the solution is less than m + n \u22121. In\nsuch cases, assign a small value \u03b5 to as many non-\nbasic variables as needed to augment to m + n \u22121\nvariables. The problem is solved in the usual way\ntreating the \u03b5 cells as basic cells. As soon as the\noptimum solution is obtained, let \u03b5 \u21920.\n38.8\nTransportation Problem\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nStarting Solution:\nExample 1:\nObtain a (non arti\ufb01cial) starting basic\nsolution to the following transportation problem\nusing (a) North west corner rule (b) Row-minimum\n(c) Column minimum (d) Least cost (Matrix minima)\n(e) Vogel\u2019s (approximation) method\nS\nS\nS\n1\n2\n3\n0\n2\n1\n4\n3\n2\n2\n4\n0\nD1\nD2\nD3\n7\n6\n6\n8\n5\n6\nSolution:\n(a) NWCR:\nS\nS\nS\n1\n2\n3\n0\n2\n1\n4\n3\n2\n2\n4\n0\nD1\nD2\nD3\n7\n6, 5\n6\n8, 1\n5\n6\n7\n1\n5\n6\nSupply as much as possible to the north-west corner\ncell (1, 1).\nCost: 7 \u00d7 0 + 1 \u00d7 4 + 5 \u00d7 3 + 6 \u00d7 0 = 19\nNote:\nThis is a degenerate solution because it con-\ntains only 4 basic variables (instead of 3 + 3 \u22121 = 5\nbasic variables).\n(b) Row Minimum\nS\nS\nS\n1\n2\n3\n0\n2\n1\n4\n3\n2\n2\n4\n0\nD1\nD2\nD3\n7\n6, 1\n6, 5\n8, 1\n5\n6\n7\n1\n1\n5\n5\n1\nAllot as much as possible in the \ufb01rst row to the cell\nwith least (minimum) cost i.e. (1, 1).

Suppose there are\nn persons who can perform any of the n different\njobs with varying degree of ef\ufb01ciency measured in\nterms of cij representing the cost of assigning the i th\nperson to j th job (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . n, j = 1, 2, . . . n)\nThen the objective of the assignment problem is to\nminimize the total cost of performing all the n jobs by\nassigning \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d on the one to\none basis of one person to one job. The assignment\nproblem can be solved as a regular transportation\nproblem in which the persons represent the sources,\nthejobsrepresentthedestinations,thesupplyamount\nat each source and demand amount at each destina-\ntion being exactly equal to 1.\nLetxij =\n 1 if ith person assigned to j th job\n0 if ith person not assigned to j th job\nSince the ith person can be assigned to only one\njob we have\nn \ni=1\nxij = 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . n.\nSince the j th job can be assigned to only one\nperson we have\nn \ni=1\nxij = 1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The\nassignment problem consists of determining the inte-\ngers xij (either 1 or 0) such that the total cost rep-\nresented by the objective function\nn \ni=1\nn \nj=1\ncij xij is\nminimized. Thus the assignment problem is an inte-\nger linear programming problem. This combinato-\nrial problem has n! number of possible assignments\nwhich can be enumerated for small n. Even for n =\n10, (n! = 3,628,800) the enumeration becomes very\ntime consuming and cumbersome. However the solu-\ntion to the assignment problem is obtained by a sim-\nple method known as the \u201cHungarian method\u201d or\n\u201cFloods\u2019 technique\u201d.\nHungarian Method or Flood\u2019s Technique\n1. Minimization case:\nStep I. Determination of total-opportunity cost\n(TOC) matrix:\n(a) Subtracting the lowest entry of each column of the\ngiven payoff (cost) matrix from all the entries of\nthat corresponding column results in the column-\nopportunity cost matrix.\n(b) Now subtracting the lowest entry of each row of\nthe column-opportunity matrix (obtained in step\n(a) above) from all the entries of the correspond-\ning row results in the total opportunity cost (TOC)\nmatrix.\nStep II. Check for optimal assignment: Let n be\nthe minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines\nrequired which cover ALL the zeros in the current\nTOC matrix. Let m be the order of the cost (TOC)\nmatrix.\n(a) If n = m, an optimal assignment can be made.\nGoto step V\n(b) If n < m, revise the TOC matrix. Goto step III.\nStep III. Revision of TOC matrix:\n(a) Subtract the lowest entry (among the uncovered\ncells) of the current TOC matrix from all the\nuncovered cells.\n(b) Add this lowest entry to only those cells at which\nthe covering lines of step II cross. This revises\nTOC matrix.\n\n38.32\nMATHEMATICAL METHODS\nStep IV. Repeat steps II and III initial an optimal\nassignment is reached:\nStep V. Optimal assignment:\n(a) Identify a row or column (in the \ufb01nal TOC matrix)\nhaving only one zero cell.\n(b) Make assignment to this cell. Cross off both the\nrow and column in which this zero cell occurs.\n(c) Repeat (a) for the remaining rows and columns\nand make an assignment until a complete assign-\nment is achieved.\n2. Maximization case:\nThe maximization problem can be converted to a\nminimization problem by subtracting all the entries\nof the original cost matrix from the largest entry (of\nthe original cost matrix). The transformed entries\ngive the \u201crelative costs\u201d.\n3. Alternative Optima:\nThe presence of alternative optimal solutions is indi-\ncated by the existance of a row or column in the \ufb01nal\nTOC matrix with more than one zero cells.\n4. Unbalanced Problem:\nWhen the cost matrix is rectangular, a dummy row\nor a dummy column added makes the cost matrix a\nsquare matrix. All the costs cij associated with this\ndummy row (or column) are taken as zeros.\n5. Problem with Restrictions:\nWhen the assignment problem includes certain\nrestrictions such that a particular (speci\ufb01ed) i th per-\nson can not be assigned to a particular j th job then\nthe associated cost cij is taken as a very big value M\n(generally in\ufb01nity) so that it is prohibitively expen-\nsive to make this undesirable assignment.\nWORKED OUT EXAMPLES\nExample 1:\nA national highway project consists\nof 5 major jobs for which 5 contractors have submit-\nted tenders.

    "text": "1 | P a g e  \n \nModule-2: Sustainable Chemistry for Energy Devices \nBatteries \nEnergy storage systems are used to store various forms of energy produced at one time and used later. \nEnergy storage involves converting energy from one form that is difficult to store to more conveniently \nor economically storable forms. The device that stores energy is called as accumulator or battery. \nDefinition: Battery is a device consisting of one or more galvanic cells connected in series or parallel \nor both, which converts chemical energy into electric energy through redox reactions. \nThe basic components of a battery are \n1. Anode: At anode, anode active material undergoes oxidation reaction and liberates electron to \nthe external circuit. \nM \uf0e0 Mn+ + ne- \n2. Cathode: At cathode, cathode active material undergoes reduction reaction by accepting \nelectrons from external circuit. \nMn+ + ne- \uf0e0 M \n3. Electrolyte:  \nElectrolyte used in battery must have high ionic conductivity, chemical resistance to the \nseparator and electrode and safe to handle. Electrolyte acts as a medium to transfer the ions \nacross the anode and cathode inside the battery. \ne.g., acidic solution, alkaline solution, salt solution etc.  \n4.

Primary batteries \nBatteries where cell reactions are not reversible are called primary batteries. Once it is discharged it \ncannot be recharged. It behaves as a galvanic cell by converting chemical energy to electric energy. \nExample: Zn-MnO2 battery, Li-MnO2 battery. \n\n2 | P a g e  \n \n2. Secondary batteries \nBatteries where cell reactions are reversible are called secondary batteries. These batteries can be \nrecharged by passing external electric current. They behave like a galvanic cell during discharge and \nact as an electrolyte cell while recharging. \nExample: Lead storage battery, Ni-Cd batteries, Li-ion battery, Na-ion battery. \n3. Reserve batteries (Stand-by battery) \nBatteries in which one of the components isolated from the battery are called reserve batteries. The \nbattery is activated by the addition of this component. It has good shelf life as chemical reactions are \nprevented during the storage of battery. The key component is usually an electrolyte that is isolated \nfrom the battery. In some reserve batteries, water is separated, or heat may be the activator. These \nbatteries are designed for emergency use particularly in military applications. \nExample: Zn-Ag2O, Mg-water activated batteries. \nLithium-ion battery \nRechargeable, lithium-ion batteries possess many advantages over traditional batteries such as lead \nacid and Ni-Cd batteries.

Capacity \nBattery capacity refers to the total amount of electric charge a battery can store and deliver under \nspecified conditions. It is typically expressed in Ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh). The \ncapacity is also affected by temperature, discharge rate, and battery aging. \nIt is given by, \nCapacity(C)=I\u00d7t \nwhere, \nC = Capacity in Ah \nI = Discharge current (A) \nt = Time (h) the battery can supply current (I) \nImportance: A higher capacity means the battery can power a device for a longer time before needing \na recharge. \n2. Power density \nPower density is the amount of power (rate of energy delivery) per unit mass or volume of the battery. \nHigher power density is critical in applications requiring bursts of high energy (e.g., electric vehicles). \nThere are two types: \n1. Gravimetric power density (W/kg) \n2. Volumetric power density (W/L) \nIt is given by, \nPower density=P/m or P/V \n \n\n4 | P a g e  \n \nwhere, \nP=V\u00d7I is power in watts (W) \nm = mass of battery (kg) \nV = volume of battery (L) \nImportance: It determines how quickly energy can be delivered (high power density enables a battery \nto discharge or charge rapidly). \n3. Cell balancing \nCell balancing is the process of equalizing the voltage and state of charge (SoC) of individual cells in \na battery pack to ensure uniform performance and avoid overcharging or over-discharging. It increases \nsafety, efficiency, and cycle life of battery packs. \nThere are two types: \n1. Passive Balancing: Excess energy from higher SoC cells is dissipated as heat. \n2. Active Balancing: Excess energy is redistributed to lower SoC cells. \nIt is expressed as, \nV1=V2=V3=\u22ef=Vn or SoC1=SoC2=SoC3=..=SoCn \nWhere, \nVn is the voltage of the nth cell and n is the total number of cells. \nImportance: Prevents cells from overcharging or discharging excessively, which can damage them \nand shorten battery life. \n3. Cycle life \nCycle life is the number of complete charge-discharge cycles a battery can undergo before its capacity \ndrops below a specified threshold (usually 80% of initial capacity). \nIt is given by,      Cycle Life=Total usable lifetime capacity/ Capacity per cycle \n \nNext Generation Energy Systems \nSodium-ion battery \nThe sodium ion battery (NIB) is a type of rechargeable battery analogous to the lithium-ion battery but \nusing sodium ions (Na+) as the charge carriers. Its working principle and cell construction are almost \nidentical with those of the commercially widespread lithium-ion battery types, but sodium compounds \nare used instead of lithium compounds. \n \nSodium ion battery consists of \nAnode: Hard carbon \n\n5 | P a g e  \n \nCathode: Sodium-metal oxide (Na-MO2) \nElectrolyte: Aqueous solution (such as Na2SO4 solution) or non-aqueous solution (e.g. sodium salts \nin propylene carbonate or hexafluorophosphate). \nSeparator: Microporous polyethylene or polypropylene  \nVoltage: 3.7 V \nCell representation: Na | Na+, C | Electrolyte containing sodium salt | Na-MO2  \nReactions: \nAt anode:               Na-C6                   Na+ + e- + 6C \nAt cathode:            Na+ + e- + MO2                      NaMO2 \nNet cell reaction:  Na-C6 + MO2                 6C + NaMO2 \nWhen the battery is being charged, Na atoms in the cathode release electrons to the external circuit and \nbecome ions which migrate through the electrolyte toward the anode, where they combine with \nelectrons from the external circuit while reacting with the layered anode material. This process is \nreversed during discharge. During charging cell reactions will be reversed. The potential of the cell is \n3.7 V having high capacity, long life, and rapid recharge capacity. \nApplications in electric vehicles \nUsed in low-cost electric vehicles \n\uf0b7 \nIdeal for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and small city cars. \n\uf0b7 \nSuitable for vehicles requiring short driving ranges (about 100\u2013200 km). \nBattery packs for electric scooters and e-rickshaws \n\uf0b7 \nProvide affordable and safe energy storage. \n\uf0b7 \nOffer sufficient power for light EVs used in daily transportation or delivery. \nEnergy storage for EV charging stations \n\uf0b7 \nUsed in stationary battery systems to store renewable energy (solar/wind). \n\uf0b7 \nSupply stable, low-cost energy to EV charging or battery swapping stations. \nPower source for electric buses and commercial vehicles \n\uf0b7 \nSuitable for moderate-range vehicles with high safety requirements. \n\uf0b7 \nHigh thermal stability reduces the risk of overheating in large battery modules. \nUsed in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) \n\uf0b7 \nProvide peak power support and store regenerative braking energy. \n\uf0b7 \nHelp extend the life of lithium-ion packs in hybrid systems. \nSupport for fleet and logistics vehicles \n\uf0b7 \nCost-effective solution for delivery vans and shared mobility fleets. \n\uf0b7 \nEasy to maintain and can operate efficiently in varied temperature conditions. \nSustainable alternative for developing countries \n\uf0b7 \nSodium is abundant and inexpensive, reducing overall EV battery cost. \n\uf0b7 \nIdeal for large-scale adoption of EVs in cost-sensitive markets. \nGood performance across temperature ranges \n\uf0b7 \nPerform efficiently in hot and cold climates where lithium batteries degrade faster. \n \n\n6 | P a g e  \n \nFlow battery (Vanadium redox flow battery) \nThe redox flow batteries appear as an appropriate method for safe local stationary storage of electric \nenergy.

The electrodes in a VRB cell are carbon based generally \ngraphite. Both electrolytes are vanadium-based. The electrolyte in the positive half-cells contains \nVO2+ and VO2+ ions, while the electrolyte in the negative half-cells consists of V3+ and V2+ ions. The \nelectrolytes can be prepared by several processes, including electrolytically dissolving vanadium \npentoxide (V2O5) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The active species are normally dissolved in a strong acid, \nand the protons transport across the ion-exchange membrane to balance the charge.

These capacitors are built with a positive electrode that relies on \npseudocapacitance (Faradaic redox reaction) and a negative electrode based on electric double-layer \ncapacitance (non-Faradaic charge storage).  \nConstruction \n\uf0d8 Asymmetric electrodes: Unlike symmetrical supercapacitors, they use two different materials \nfor their electrodes \nNegative electrode (anode): Activated carbon \nPositive electrode (cathode): Transition metal oxides such as MnO\u2082 or conducting       \npolymers \n\uf0d8 Separator: A thin, porous membrane  \n\uf0d8 Electrolyte: A conductive medium (aqueous or organic)  \n\uf0d8 Current collectors: Metallic foils coated with electrode materials  \n\n8 | P a g e  \n \n \nWorking \nCharging Process \nCharge is stored differently at each electrode: \n\uf076 Cathode (+): Energy is stored chemically through Faradaic (redox) reactions. \n\uf076 Anode (-): Energy is stored physically through the formation of an electric double layer \n(EDLC). \nWhen voltage is applied, cations in the electrolyte move towards cathode and anions move towards \nanode. At cathode, for example Mn(IV) is reduced to Mn(III) via the intercalation of a cation (C+) from \nthe electrolyte. \n           \n \nDuring discharge, the reverse oxidation reaction happens. At the same time, ions from the electrolyte \nare attracted to the anode and accumulate at the electrode-electrolyte interface, forming an electric \ndouble layer.  \nApplications of ultra-small asymmetric supercapacitors in IoT/wearable devices \nUltra-small asymmetric supercapacitors power IoT and wearable devices by providing energy for \nfunctions.

The electrons travel through an external \ncircuit, generating electricity, while the protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. At the \ncathode, they combine with oxygen and electrons to form water. Thus, continuous supply of fuel and \noxidant produces a sustained flow of electric current. \nSolid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) \nA solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy from a fuel, \nlike hydrogen or natural gas, directly into electricity at high temperatures (600-1000oC). It uses a solid, \nceramic electrolyte to conduct oxide ions from the cathode to the anode, where they react with the fuel.  \nConstruction  \n \nAnode: Porous nickel\u2013zirconia cermet \nCathode: Strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) \nElectrolyte: Solid ceramic material, commonly yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which conducts oxide \nions but not electrons.  \nWorking \n\uf0d8 \nAt the cathode, oxygen from air is reduced to oxygen ions (O\u00b2\u207b). \nO\u2082 + 4e\u207b \u2192 2O\u00b2\u207b \nThese oxygen ions migrate through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode. \n\uf0d8 \nAt the anode, the fuel (H\u2082 or CO) reacts with O\u00b2\u207b ions to produce water/CO\u2082 and release \nelectrons. \nH\u2082 +O\u00b2\u207b \u2192H\u2082O+2e\u207b \nCO + O\u00b2\u207b \u2192 CO\u2082 + 2e\u207b \n\uf0d8 \nThe released electrons travel through the external circuit, generating electric current. Thus, \ncontinuous supply of hydrogen (or other fuels) and oxygen produces sustained electricity, with \nwater/CO\u2082 as by-products. \n\n10 | P a g e  \n \nSolar photovoltaic cell \nPhotovoltaic cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into direct current electricity. As \nlong as light falls on the solar cell it generates electrical power. Solar cells never need recharging. \nConstruction and working of a Photovoltaic cell  \nPrinciple: Photovoltaic cell (PV) cells work on photoelectric effect, i.e., when a light particle with \nenergy E=hv falls on a material and if the energy of photon is greater than binding energy of electron, \nthen it can eject an electron from it creating an electron hole pair. \nIn solar PV cells, when solar light falls on the material, electrons are ejected producing electron hole \npair. Then, electrons are separated from holes and made to move through external circuit to recombine \nwith hole. This movement of electrons through an external circuit generates electric current. \n \nConstruction \nA typical silicon photovoltaic cell is composed of a thin wafer consisting of an ultra-thin layer of \nPhosphorous doped silicon (n \u2013 type) on top of Boron doped silicon (p- type). Hence a p-n junction is \nformed between the two. PV cell mainly consists of a p-n junction diode made from Si semiconductor. \nA metallic grid forms one of the electrical contacts of the diode & allows light to fall on semiconductor. \nAn antireflective layer (silicon nitride or TiO2) between the grids increases the amount of light \ntransmitted to the semiconductor. A metallic layer (Ag) on the back of the solar cell is used as other \nside electric contact.  \nWorking \nWhen light radiation falls on a p\u2013n junction diode, electron\u2013hole pairs are generated due to the \nabsorption of photons energy. The electrons are driven towards the n-type region, while the holes move \ntowards the p-type region. Since the p\u2013n junction permits unidirectional movement of charge carriers, \nthe electrons accumulate on the n-side and the holes on the p-side. When the two ends of PV cell are \nconnected through an external circuit, electrons flow from the n-side to the p-side and recombine with \nthe holes. This movement of electrons through the external circuit constitutes an electric current. Thus, \na photovoltaic (photoelectric) current is produced. \n\n11 | P a g e  \n \nProduction of hydrogen by electrolysis of alkaline water \nThe cell consists of a pair of electrodes separated by a diaphragm filled with 25\u201330% potassium \nhydroxide. At the cathode, water undergoes reduction to produce hydrogen gas (H\u2082) and hydroxide \nions (OH\u207b). These hydroxide ions migrate through the diaphragm and participate in the oxidation \nreaction at the anode, leading to the evolution of oxygen gas (O\u2082). The diaphragm separates the anode \nand cathode compartments to prevent the mixing of H\u2082 and O\u2082. \nCathode: Nickel \nAnode: Ni oxides, or NiCo2O4 (Nickel cobaltite) on Ti. \nElectrolyte: Aqueous solution of KOH or NaOH \nTemperature: 50-90 \u00b0C \nPressure: 30 bar \n \nProduction: This is represented by the following half-reactions, \nAt cathode: 2H2O+2e\u2212 \u2192 H2\u2191+2OH\u2212 \nAt Anode: 2OH\u2212 \u2192  \u00bd O2\u2191+H2O+2e\u2212 \nOverall Reaction: 2H2O(l) \u2192 2H2(g)+O2(g) \nApplications of Green hydrogen \n1.

    "text": "1 \nModule 2 : Statements \nCHAPTER 3 \nStatements: \n\uf0b7 \nA statement in C is an executable part of a program specifying an action. \n\uf0b7 \nC statements are categorized into these types: \n1. Selection: if, switch (also called conditional statements) \n2. Iteration: while, for, do-while (also called loops) \n3. Jump: break, continue, goto, return \n4. Label: case, default, and label statements \n5. Expression: statements that are valid expressions \n6. Block: code blocks enclosed in { } (also called compound statements) \nSelection Statements: \n\uf0b7 \nC has two selection statements: if and switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ? (ternary) operator is an alternative to if in some cases. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral form of if statement: \n \n\uf0b7 \nA statement can be a single statement, a block of statements, or empty. \n\uf0b7 \nThe else part is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the expression is true (non-zero), the if block executes. \n\uf0b7 \nOtherwise, the else block executes if present. \n\uf0b7 \nOnly one block runs: either if or else, never both. \n \nExample : \nWrite a C program to guess the magic number \n \n2 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe program is a simple \"guess the magic number\" game. It prints Right if the player \nguesses correctly. The magic number is generated using rand() from <stdlib.h>, which \nreturns a number between 0 and RAND_MAX (at least 32,767). The next version uses \nan else statement to print a message for a wrong guess. \n \n \nNested ifs \n\uf0b7 \nA nested if is an if statement inside another if or else. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs are common in programming. \n\uf0b7 \nAn else always matches the nearest if in the same block without an else. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner else pairs with its nearest if. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs can improve the magic number game by giving feedback on wrong guesses as \nshown in the program below, \n \n3 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nThe if-else-if Ladder \nA common programming construct is the if-else-if ladder, sometimes called the if-else-if staircase \nbecause of its appearance. Its general form is \n          \n \n\uf0b7 \nConditions are checked from top to bottom. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a true condition is found, its associated statement runs. \n\uf0b7 \nThe rest of the conditions are skipped after that. \n\uf0b7 \nIf no condition is true, the final else runs. \n\uf0b7 \nIf there is no final else and all conditions fail, no action happens. \n \n4 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nUsing an if-else-if ladder, the magic number program becomes as follows: \n \n \n \nThe ? Alternative  \nHere\u2019s a simple breakdown of the ternary (?) operator: \n\uf0b7 \nIt replaces simple if-else assignment statements: \n \n\uf0b7 The general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nHow it works: \n\uf0b7 \nEvaluate Exp1 (the condition). \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, value is Exp2. \n\uf0b7 \nIf false, value is Exp3. \n\uf0b7 \nIt\u2019s called ternary because it has three parts (operands). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: if x >= 9, then y = 100, else y = 200. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is equivalent to a simple if-else assigning y based on x. \nUsing the ? operator, you can rewrite the magic number program yet again, In the magic number \nprogram below , the ? operator displays the proper message based on the outcome of the test guess \n> magic. \n \n \n5 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe Conditional Expression \n\uf0b7 \nIn C, any valid expression can control an if or ? operator. \n\uf0b7 \nExpressions don\u2019t have to use only relational or logical operators. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression just needs to evaluate to true (nonzero) or false (0). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: a program reads two integers and shows their quotient. \n\uf0b7 \nIt uses if to check the second number to prevent divide-by-zero errors. \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is 0, the if condition is false, so else runs. \n \n6 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is nonzero, the if condition is true, and division happens. \n\uf0b7 \nWriting if (b != 0) instead of if (b) is redundant and less efficient. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing just if (b) is clearer and better style. \nSwitch \n\uf0b7 \nC provides a multiple-branch selection statement called switch. \n\uf0b7 \nIt tests an expression\u2019s value against several integer or character constants. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the corresponding statements run. \n\uf0b7 \nThe general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe switch expression must be an integer type (integer or character), not floating-point. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression\u2019s value is compared one-by-one to each case constant. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the associated statements run until a break or the end of the switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe default case runs if no matches are found; it is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nbreak jumps execution out of the switch to the next line after it. \n\uf0b7 \nKey points about switch: \n\uf0b7 \nOnly tests equality, unlike if which can test any condition. \n\uf0b7 \nCase constants must be unique within a switch. \n\uf0b7 \nCharacter cases convert automatically to integers. \n\uf0b7 \nswitch is often used for handling keyboard commands or menu choices. \nAs shown here, the function menu( ) displays a menu for a spelling-checker program and calls the \nproper procedures: \n \n7 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe break statement in a switch is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf break is omitted, execution falls through to the next case\u2019s statements. \n\uf0b7 \nThis \"fall through\" continues until a break or the end of the switch is reached. \n\uf0b7 \nThis behavior can simplify code by letting multiple cases share code in a single block. \n\uf0b7 \nWithout a break, cases below the matched case will also run, which can be intentional or \ncause errors if unintentional. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing break is important to stop execution after the matched case block. \nNested switch Statements  \n\uf0b7 \nou can have a switch inside another switch; the inner switch is part of the outer switch's \nstatement sequence. \n\uf0b7 \nThe outer and inner switches can have case constants with the same values without \nconflict. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner switch executes only when the outer switch matches its case that contains the \ninner switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThis allows handling complex decisions with nested conditions. \n \n8 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nIteration Statements \nIn C , iteration statements (also called loops) allow a set of instructions to be repeatedly \nexecuted until a certain condition is reached. This condition may be predetermined (as in the for \nloop) or open ended (as in the while and do-while loops). \nfor Loop in C  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop repeats a set of instructions multiple times. \n\uf0b7 \nIt works by entering a loop and running code while a condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral syntax: \n \n\uf0b7 \nInitialization sets the loop variable once at the start. \n\uf0b7 \nCondition is checked before each loop iteration; if false, the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nIncrement updates the loop variable after each iteration. \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop continues while the condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce false, execution moves to the code after the loop. \nIn the following program, a for loop is used to print the numbers 1 through 100 on the screen: \n \n \n9 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop initializes xx to 1. \n\uf0b7 \nIt checks if xx is less than or equal to 100. \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, it runs the printf() statement. \n\uf0b7 \nAfter printing, xx is increased by 1. \n\uf0b7 \nThe condition is checked again for the updated xx. \n\uf0b7 \nThis repeats until xx becomes greater than 100. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce x>100x>100, the loop terminates and the program continues. \n\uf0b7 \nx is called the loop control variable because it controls loop execution by changing and \nbeing tested each time. \n\uf0b7 \nIn for loops, the conditional test is always performed at the top of the loop. This means \nthat the code inside the loop may not be executed at all if the condition is false to begin \nwith. \nfor Loop Variations \n1)The comma operator allows multiple variables to be controlled in a single for loop. \n\uf0b7 \nYou can initialize and update more than one variable within the for statement using \ncommas. \n \n\uf0b7 \nHere, variables x and y initialized together in the for statement. \n\uf0b7 \nEach loop iteration increments x and updates y with input from the keyboard. \n\uf0b7 \nBoth x and y need correct values for the loop to stop. \n\uf0b7 \ny must be initialized (e.g., y=0) before the loop so its value is defined at the start. \n2)The initialization and increment parts of the for loop can contain any valid expressions or \nfunction calls, not just simple variable updates.  \n \n10 \nModule 2 : Statements \nThe C program below demonstrates the same, \n \n \n3)Another interesting trait of the for loop is that pieces of the loop definition need not be there. \n\u2014 the expressions are optional. For example, this loop will run until the user enters 123: \n \nThe Infinite Loop  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop can create an infinite loop by leaving the condition empty. \n \n\uf0b7 \nSince no condition is given, the loop never ends naturally. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is a traditional way to write an endless loop in C. \n \n11 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop runs forever until externally stopped or broken with a statement like break. \n \nThe while Loop \nThe general form of the while loop is , \n \nThe C program below demonstrates the use of the while loop, \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nch is initialized to null before the while loop starts. \n\uf0b7 \nThe while loop continues as long as ch is not equal to 'A'. \n\uf0b7 \nSince ch starts as null, the loop condition is true initially and the loop runs. \n\uf0b7 \nEach time you press a key, ch updates, and the condition is checked again. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen you enter 'A', the condition becomes false; the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nwhile loops check the test condition at the top of the loop,the body of the loop will not \nexecute if the condition is false to begin with. \nThe do-while Loop \n\uf0b7 Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do-\nwhile loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.  \n\uf0b7 This means that a do-while loop always executes at least once. \n\uf0b7 The general form of the do-while loop is , \n \n \n12 \nModule 2 : Statements \nFor Example , The following do-while loop will read numbers from the keyboard until it finds a \nnumber less than or equal to 100: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe do-while loop is ideal for menu selection because it runs the menu at least once. \n\uf0b7 \nThe menu displays options and waits for the user\u2019s choice. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is valid, it returns that choice and exits the loop. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is invalid, the loop repeats and prompts the user again. \n\uf0b7 \nThis guarantees the menu shows repeatedly until a valid option is se"

    "text": "Multivariable Calculus Problems \u2014 Solutions\nProblem 1: Verify $u_{xy} = u_{yx}$\nGiven: u = ex(x cos x - y sin y). We write u = ex x cos x - ex y sin y.\nStep 1: Find ux\nDifferentiate with respect to x, treating y constant:\nux = &partial;/&partial;x (ex x cos x) - &partial;/&partial;x (ex y sin y)\nFirst term (product rule for three factors):\n&partial;/&partial;x (ex x cos x) = exx cos x + ex cos x - ex x sin x\nSecond term (y sin y constant w.r.t. x):\n&partial;/&partial;x (ex y sin y) = y sin y \u00b7 ex\nCombine:\nux = ex(x cos x + cos x - x sin x - y sin y).\nStep 2: Find uy\nDifferentiate w.r.t. y, treating x constant:\nuy = 0 - ex(&sin; y + y cos y) = -ex(&sin; y + y cos y).\nStep 3: Find uxy\nDifferentiate ux w.r.t. y. Only the -ex y sin y term depends on y:\nuxy = -ex(&sin; y + y cos y).\nStep 4: Find uyx\nDifferentiate uy w.r.t. x. Treat (&sin; y + y cos y) constant:\nuyx = -ex(&sin; y + y cos y).\nConclusion: uxy = uyx = -ex(&sin; y + y cos y).\nProblem 2: Find zxx - a2 zyy\nGiven: z = tan(y + a x) + (y - a x)3/2.\nStep 1: Find zx and zxx\nzx = a sec2(y+ax) - (3a/2)(y-ax)1/2.\nDifferentiate w.r.t. x:\nzxx = 2 a2 sec2(y+ax) tan(y+ax) + (3 a2/4)(y-ax)-1/2.\nStep 2: Find zy and zyy\nzy = sec2(y+ax) + (3/2)(y-ax)1/2.\nDifferentiate w.r.t. y:\nzyy = 2 sec2(y+ax) tan(y+ax) + (3/4)(y-ax)-1/2.\nStep 3: Compute zxx - a2 zyy\na2 zyy = 2 a2 sec2(y+ax) tan(y+ax) + (3 a2/4)(y-ax)-1/2.\nSubtracting from zxx gives zero; hence:\nzxx - a2 zyy = 0.\nProblem 3: Find ux + uy + uz\nGiven: u = log(x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz).\nUsing chain rule for log:\nux = (3x2 - 3yz) / (x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz)\nuy = (3y2 - 3xz) / (x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz)\nuz = (3z2 - 3xy) / (x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz)\nSum them (common denominator):\nux + uy + uz = 3(x2 + y2 + z2 - xy - yz - zx) / (x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz)\nUse identity: x3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x2+y2+z2 - xy - yz - zx)\nCancel the common factor to obtain:\nux + uy + uz = 3 / (x + y + z).\nGenerated PDF of solutions."

    "text": "1 \nModule 2 : Statements \nCHAPTER 3 \nStatements: \n\uf0b7 \nA statement in C is an executable part of a program specifying an action. \n\uf0b7 \nC statements are categorized into these types: \n1. Selection: if, switch (also called conditional statements) \n2. Iteration: while, for, do-while (also called loops) \n3. Jump: break, continue, goto, return \n4. Label: case, default, and label statements \n5. Expression: statements that are valid expressions \n6. Block: code blocks enclosed in { } (also called compound statements) \nSelection Statements: \n\uf0b7 \nC has two selection statements: if and switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ? (ternary) operator is an alternative to if in some cases. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral form of if statement: \n \n\uf0b7 \nA statement can be a single statement, a block of statements, or empty. \n\uf0b7 \nThe else part is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the expression is true (non-zero), the if block executes. \n\uf0b7 \nOtherwise, the else block executes if present. \n\uf0b7 \nOnly one block runs: either if or else, never both. \n \nExample : \nWrite a C program to guess the magic number \n \n2 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe program is a simple \"guess the magic number\" game. It prints Right if the player \nguesses correctly. The magic number is generated using rand() from <stdlib.h>, which \nreturns a number between 0 and RAND_MAX (at least 32,767). The next version uses \nan else statement to print a message for a wrong guess. \n \n \nNested ifs \n\uf0b7 \nA nested if is an if statement inside another if or else. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs are common in programming. \n\uf0b7 \nAn else always matches the nearest if in the same block without an else. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner else pairs with its nearest if. \n\uf0b7 \nNested ifs can improve the magic number game by giving feedback on wrong guesses as \nshown in the program below, \n \n3 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nThe if-else-if Ladder \nA common programming construct is the if-else-if ladder, sometimes called the if-else-if staircase \nbecause of its appearance. Its general form is \n          \n \n\uf0b7 \nConditions are checked from top to bottom. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a true condition is found, its associated statement runs. \n\uf0b7 \nThe rest of the conditions are skipped after that. \n\uf0b7 \nIf no condition is true, the final else runs. \n\uf0b7 \nIf there is no final else and all conditions fail, no action happens. \n \n4 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nUsing an if-else-if ladder, the magic number program becomes as follows: \n \n \n \nThe ? Alternative  \nHere\u2019s a simple breakdown of the ternary (?) operator: \n\uf0b7 \nIt replaces simple if-else assignment statements: \n \n\uf0b7 The general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nHow it works: \n\uf0b7 \nEvaluate Exp1 (the condition). \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, value is Exp2. \n\uf0b7 \nIf false, value is Exp3. \n\uf0b7 \nIt\u2019s called ternary because it has three parts (operands). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: if x >= 9, then y = 100, else y = 200. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is equivalent to a simple if-else assigning y based on x. \nUsing the ? operator, you can rewrite the magic number program yet again, In the magic number \nprogram below , the ? operator displays the proper message based on the outcome of the test guess \n> magic. \n \n \n5 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \nThe Conditional Expression \n\uf0b7 \nIn C, any valid expression can control an if or ? operator. \n\uf0b7 \nExpressions don\u2019t have to use only relational or logical operators. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression just needs to evaluate to true (nonzero) or false (0). \n\uf0b7 \nExample: a program reads two integers and shows their quotient. \n\uf0b7 \nIt uses if to check the second number to prevent divide-by-zero errors. \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is 0, the if condition is false, so else runs. \n \n6 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nIf b is nonzero, the if condition is true, and division happens. \n\uf0b7 \nWriting if (b != 0) instead of if (b) is redundant and less efficient. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing just if (b) is clearer and better style. \nSwitch \n\uf0b7 \nC provides a multiple-branch selection statement called switch. \n\uf0b7 \nIt tests an expression\u2019s value against several integer or character constants. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the corresponding statements run. \n\uf0b7 \nThe general form is: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe switch expression must be an integer type (integer or character), not floating-point. \n\uf0b7 \nThe expression\u2019s value is compared one-by-one to each case constant. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen a match is found, the associated statements run until a break or the end of the switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThe default case runs if no matches are found; it is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nbreak jumps execution out of the switch to the next line after it. \n\uf0b7 \nKey points about switch: \n\uf0b7 \nOnly tests equality, unlike if which can test any condition. \n\uf0b7 \nCase constants must be unique within a switch. \n\uf0b7 \nCharacter cases convert automatically to integers. \n\uf0b7 \nswitch is often used for handling keyboard commands or menu choices. \nAs shown here, the function menu( ) displays a menu for a spelling-checker program and calls the \nproper procedures: \n \n7 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe break statement in a switch is optional. \n\uf0b7 \nIf break is omitted, execution falls through to the next case\u2019s statements. \n\uf0b7 \nThis \"fall through\" continues until a break or the end of the switch is reached. \n\uf0b7 \nThis behavior can simplify code by letting multiple cases share code in a single block. \n\uf0b7 \nWithout a break, cases below the matched case will also run, which can be intentional or \ncause errors if unintentional. \n\uf0b7 \nUsing break is important to stop execution after the matched case block. \nNested switch Statements  \n\uf0b7 \nou can have a switch inside another switch; the inner switch is part of the outer switch's \nstatement sequence. \n\uf0b7 \nThe outer and inner switches can have case constants with the same values without \nconflict. \n\uf0b7 \nThe inner switch executes only when the outer switch matches its case that contains the \ninner switch. \n\uf0b7 \nThis allows handling complex decisions with nested conditions. \n \n8 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n \nIteration Statements \nIn C , iteration statements (also called loops) allow a set of instructions to be repeatedly \nexecuted until a certain condition is reached. This condition may be predetermined (as in the for \nloop) or open ended (as in the while and do-while loops). \nfor Loop in C  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop repeats a set of instructions multiple times. \n\uf0b7 \nIt works by entering a loop and running code while a condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nGeneral syntax: \n \n\uf0b7 \nInitialization sets the loop variable once at the start. \n\uf0b7 \nCondition is checked before each loop iteration; if false, the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nIncrement updates the loop variable after each iteration. \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop continues while the condition is true. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce false, execution moves to the code after the loop. \nIn the following program, a for loop is used to print the numbers 1 through 100 on the screen: \n \n \n9 \nModule 2 : Statements \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop initializes xx to 1. \n\uf0b7 \nIt checks if xx is less than or equal to 100. \n\uf0b7 \nIf true, it runs the printf() statement. \n\uf0b7 \nAfter printing, xx is increased by 1. \n\uf0b7 \nThe condition is checked again for the updated xx. \n\uf0b7 \nThis repeats until xx becomes greater than 100. \n\uf0b7 \nOnce x>100x>100, the loop terminates and the program continues. \n\uf0b7 \nx is called the loop control variable because it controls loop execution by changing and \nbeing tested each time. \n\uf0b7 \nIn for loops, the conditional test is always performed at the top of the loop. This means \nthat the code inside the loop may not be executed at all if the condition is false to begin \nwith. \nfor Loop Variations \n1)The comma operator allows multiple variables to be controlled in a single for loop. \n\uf0b7 \nYou can initialize and update more than one variable within the for statement using \ncommas. \n \n\uf0b7 \nHere, variables x and y initialized together in the for statement. \n\uf0b7 \nEach loop iteration increments x and updates y with input from the keyboard. \n\uf0b7 \nBoth x and y need correct values for the loop to stop. \n\uf0b7 \ny must be initialized (e.g., y=0) before the loop so its value is defined at the start. \n2)The initialization and increment parts of the for loop can contain any valid expressions or \nfunction calls, not just simple variable updates.  \n \n10 \nModule 2 : Statements \nThe C program below demonstrates the same, \n \n \n3)Another interesting trait of the for loop is that pieces of the loop definition need not be there. \n\u2014 the expressions are optional. For example, this loop will run until the user enters 123: \n \nThe Infinite Loop  \n\uf0b7 \nThe for loop can create an infinite loop by leaving the condition empty. \n \n\uf0b7 \nSince no condition is given, the loop never ends naturally. \n\uf0b7 \nThis is a traditional way to write an endless loop in C. \n \n11 \nModule 2 : Statements \n\uf0b7 \nThe loop runs forever until externally stopped or broken with a statement like break. \n \nThe while Loop \nThe general form of the while loop is , \n \nThe C program below demonstrates the use of the while loop, \n \nHere, \n\uf0b7 \nch is initialized to null before the while loop starts. \n\uf0b7 \nThe while loop continues as long as ch is not equal to 'A'. \n\uf0b7 \nSince ch starts as null, the loop condition is true initially and the loop runs. \n\uf0b7 \nEach time you press a key, ch updates, and the condition is checked again. \n\uf0b7 \nWhen you enter 'A', the condition becomes false; the loop ends. \n\uf0b7 \nwhile loops check the test condition at the top of the loop,the body of the loop will not \nexecute if the condition is false to begin with. \nThe do-while Loop \n\uf0b7 Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do-\nwhile loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.  \n\uf0b7 This means that a do-while loop always executes at least once. \n\uf0b7 The general form of the do-while loop is , \n \n \n12 \nModule 2 : Statements \nFor Example , The following do-while loop will read numbers from the keyboard until it finds a \nnumber less than or equal to 100: \n \n\uf0b7 \nThe do-while loop is ideal for menu selection because it runs the menu at least once. \n\uf0b7 \nThe menu displays options and waits for the user\u2019s choice. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is valid, it returns that choice and exits the loop. \n\uf0b7 \nIf the choice is invalid, the loop repeats and prompts the user again. \n\uf0b7 \nThis guarantees the menu shows repeatedly until a valid option is se"
